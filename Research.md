This is a placeholder for the content that will be added about Research.  

Whilst works are underway to seek to produce a far better 'library' solution, in the meantime there is a google Drive folder that is more broadly produced for the Peace Infrastructure Project as a whole...   The link to this library is: [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tYFIggw8MIY5fD2u-nbwFRM6wqrhdmQZ) and the information will otherwise be updated ASAP...  (when i get to it...)

FWIW Also; The system used to produce this documentation, hasn't been found to be very good for handling an array of different types of content and thereafter also, indexing, etc... 

step-by-step ;)

Cheers...
