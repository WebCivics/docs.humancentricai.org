# Web Civics Charter

The Web Civics Charter is being defined to provide an outline of what is expected of persons and what persons should expect, when being involved in any Web Civics Project, including but not limited to the communities that have been established to support the positive development of Human Centric AI technologies, policies, recommendations, communities and all such related activities and works.

## Guiding principles & Instruments

The primary objects that are employed to define expectations with respect to how we are sought to honourably support the welfare, rights and responsibilities that are inextricably linked to our means to support progress in a manner that uplifts human dignity for ourselves, one-another and those who may be impacted by the consequences of our thoughtful behaviours, is defined by way of the [[ValuesCredentials]].  These instruments seek to provide comprehensive coverage of various considerations that may be used in connection to any activities that invoke a requirement for moderation, mediation and/or intervention & action.

## Personal Undertakings.

It is sought that all persons who seek to be involved and to maintain good standing in connection to their involvement, seek always to act in a [[BestEfforts]] manner towards goals and/or pursuits that are [[FitForPurpose]] in connection to the values outlined by the [[ValuesCredentials]] and in-particular therein, those instruments that are supported as universal declarations in connection to the fundamental rights of children and all other members of our human family; and through us, our means to positively support the thrivability of our biosphere, sociosphere and general capacity to support positive & peaceful development.

Whilst there are many systems that provide an illustrative outline of what the general concept of behaviours that are associated with terms such as 'worshipful' or 'honourable', one such illustration is provided below.

## Wrongs

A list of [[SocialAttackVectors]] is being developed.  Broader works are in-turn seeking to produce [[SafetyProtocols]] that are intended to have the effect of better enabling the means for people to triage and address issues of importance to them and their loved-ones; however, presently, there is a great deal more work that most certainly needs to be done before any such forms of solutions can be brought about.  

Nowtherefore; As Such,

If there are behaviours or issues that are not mentioned by one of the existing notes about [[SocialAttackVectors]], then we are interested in adding to them.  If one of those issues is poorly described, then we welcome assistance in seeking to improve these documents. 

If you are subjected to behaviours that relate to any of those sorts of issues, then the following process is sought to be employed.

It is important to ensure that any complaint and/or incident is properly documented. Issues can be complex, and sometimes it is also important to protect the person who is alledged to have engaged in wrong-doing when in-fact the real-world situation may well be more complex.  In the event that an incident that gives rise to concerns is identified, please try to obtain a screen-shot or whatever evidence you are able to collect (without unnecessarily breaching the rights of other persons as defined in the [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments); and thereby notify either notify a moderator or administrator on the platform you are on; or alternatively, email: abuse@humancentricai.org.   

If the issue appears to relate to serious criminal issues, it is expected that these matters be reported; so that they may in-turn be, at least, logged.
