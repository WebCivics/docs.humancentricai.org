All persons who are involved with Web Civics and/or any of its projects, including but not exclusive to this Human Centric AI community initiative; is expected, at all times, to act in a manner that seeks to protect the inaliable Human Rights of Children and any other persons who may be considered to have a relationship of dependence upon the implications of these works.  These moral expectations seek enact our moral responsibility to ensure the protection of all persons who require guardianship support whether it be for a short period of time or more permenantly; and/or, whether it relates to a specified topic or area of expertise, or whether it relates to persons more generally due to disability or impairment.

If Human Centric AI is to be successful, it must consider how it will support those who require assistance in life and by law, in-order to support the rights set-out by the instruments noted by the various [[ValuesCredentials]].  The implications will in turn have impacts and implications with respect to institutions who have important roles in the lives of all persons. 

At many stages in our lives, irraspective of our circumstances; we and our loved ones will be in a circumstance of dependence upon others, at various stages in our lives; particularly at times where we are unconscious or unaware of the manifest circumstances related to us and/or our loved ones. 

It is important that we may measurebly support how it is that we are able to define and respond to the nature and characterisation of what people do in these circumstances and seek to apply the terms outlined by the [[ValuesCredentials]] fairly and proportionately via lawfully appropriate and proportionate means.  It is essential, that we improve our means to support those who may engage in difficult and otherwise unrecognised works that benefit others; whilst it is also essential to seek to ensure that those who do otherwise are not rendered meaningful assistance to gainfully enrich their lives by doing the opposite.
