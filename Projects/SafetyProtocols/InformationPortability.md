# Information Portability

Data Portability is an essential requirement for various reasons.  

The works performed by this Web Civics - Human Centric AI Community will at all times make [[BestEfforts]] to seek to ensure that the tooling that is produced does not have the effect of binding persons to any gainful relationship of dependence in a manner that if done via means other than through the use of technology would clearly breach [[ValuesCredentials]] related terms and considerations.

The [Data Portability Project](https://datatransferproject.dev/) whose Current Contributors include Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, SmugMug and Twitter is an example, and the GitHub Repo for it is: [google/data-transfer-project](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project)
