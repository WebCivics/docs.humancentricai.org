# The Work Project

The 'Work Project' has a multitude of constituencies, and is basically motivated by a desire to prioritise [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] in relation to [[KnowledgeWork]].

Some very early stage front-end works have been started and are available in this repo on [github](https://github.com/WebCivics/CooperativeProjects).  Yet, there is a long-history of related works and links that i'll add to the Work Project folder at some stage (when i get to it)...

The Work project is perhaps one of the most essential elements to the broader Peace Infrastructure Project, including but not limited to; the enabling works described as being constituencies of WebCivics alongside that of Webizen are intended to produce an environment that supports the means to provide economic models that better support the needs of those who are primarily engaged in fields of [[KnowledgeWork]] in particular; yet, the methodologies have an array of other applications more broadly.

These other usecases will seek to consider producing a means to provide tools for people whose lives would be benefited if they were more easily able to manage their ability to engage with a multitude of employers and those whose type of work involves multiple clients  providing payments for their services; alongside other use-cases more broadly.  

However, the fundamental requirement of the work prject, is to support both; the works relating to the development of WebCivics, which will continue to develop works that are more focused on [[WebScience]] activities; alongside, Webizen and the WebizenAlliance (and/or WebCivics Alliance) requirements. The means to do anything else hinges upon the ability to produce a platform that is designed to be made able to support how any other forms of work are able to be done, using it.  As such; the critical technical requirements are now being made part of the Human Centric Web project. It is hoped that better solutions will emerge through the growth of participants doing useful works (or works that become useful).

## Background Notes

The Work Project is something that various attempts have been made to produce since 2000. 

In 2019 a study was undertaken listing all of the [[ValueAccountingInitiatives]] that existed at that time, as an effort was being made to raise capital to put some pieces together; and then, 2000 rolled around and alot of things changed for a lot of people. 

Fundamentally, when seeking to apply these considerations towards the intended focus of seeking to ensure [[BestEfforts]] are being made towards [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] whilst seeking to improve how [[ValuesCredentials]] are materially supported; in areas relating to the use of resources for the production of works that have an intended purpose of being good for humanity (ie: stuff, that's not really purely 'commercial' in form); but that it is entirely reasonable (indeed important) that persons are treated equitably, particularly those engaged in activities that are focused upon achiving positive outcomes linked to [[ValuesCredentials]] related considerations.  Certainly, the idea that such forms of work should be exploited and punitively discouraged; whilst actively promoting and endorsing via transactional activity those who gainfully do the opposite, certainly brings with it an array of implications.

*ideologies that are not compatible with [[WebCivicsCharter]] or related instruments...*

The applied consideration; Is to support a framework where all forms of [[ProjectFinancing]] are treated equally.  That is, that if unpaid or funded work is undertaken by someone and the useful derivatives of that contribution are useful; then, they're treated in the same way as any other investor - subject to an array of particular terms, to better contextualise the nature of the circumstance, etc.  This seeks to engender rules that basically act to support 'good faith relations' in a manner that attends to the intended meaning fo the statements outlined by the [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments,  structurally.

Thereafter, there is an array of [[ContributionClassifications]] that are importantly defined which then have implications on the [[WorkValuationMethods]] and in-turn also, the licensing frameworks.  

There are an array of [[SocialAttackVectors]] that will directly target these constituencies of the ecosystem.  It is important that there are both clear rules and systems in place to address disputes.  The [[LicensingFrameworks]] will be particularly attentive to circumstances in which works relate to the fundemental rights of Human Beings (ie: Core [[ValuesCredentials]] ); and will distinguish between natural persons (human beings), organisations with reduced means vs. users who are enterprise, large corporations, Government and other similar sorts of entities whose nature is different and that there is a capacity to form licensing frameworks for those types of users in a manner that distinguishes their obligations differently to those of others. 

This type of mechanism is intended to provide the means to support [[KnowledgeWork]] compensation for the development and creation of tooling that is required to support the foundational requirements of tooling relating to the Peace Infrastructure Project in a manner that seeks compensatory revenues (income) from organisations; whom, for example, may be defined as having a cash flow of above $3m AUD Per Annum or by way of structural identity frameworks (ie: in circumstances where analysis is not feasible); as may be determined; whilst,

*Providing the derivative tooling free of charge to all other users.*  

In other circumstances; where the work-derivative is some sort of 'optional' `#thing` then the cost may be collected from all users at some rate defined by the projects leaders; but that, the overall compensatory amount is sought to be built upon a fixed return for the total effort calc (ie: [[ProjectFinancing]] ); for whatever that body of work is defined as being.  In some cases, work will continue to provide new versions and/or additional maintainence and support for whatever that thing is; which in-turn, ends-up being attributed to the economic frameworks associated with that thing.

Whilst conceptually supported; yet not at all the focus at present, if someone invents something that is entirely optional, as in - its a market based product that might be distinct, yet, a persons life (ie: [[ValuesCredentials]] ) are not going to be disaffected by not having it; then, whoever sells it is entirely entitled to seek to charge whatever they want; and if people want to pay for it, that's really upto them.  as they say 'its a free market'; yet, these sorts of considerations do not apply to works that are critical for Peace Infrastructure Project related purposes.  

**Donations**: if people want to make donations or gift to persons above and beyond the project related economic protocols; that's ok, but also not sought to be required.

We're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.
