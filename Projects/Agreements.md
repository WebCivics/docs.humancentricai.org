## Introduction

There are a variety of works underway that seek to establish ‘human centric’ ICT outcomes.  In-order for people to be able to form agreements with one-another, as may in-turn also be used for such things as the support of rights and responsibilities, there needs to be a way to support agreements.

Agreements are considered to be different the way most online ‘terms of service’ and other legal considerations are currently normatively delivered via online systems, in the form of a mandate whether that mandate be considered optional or otherwise.
### What is an Agreement?

An agreement is a shared understanding between multiple parties that defines the terms and conditions of their interactions. Agreements can be formal or informal, and they can be written or unwritten. Agreements are generally considered to be associated with the administration of justice and law.  On the internet, there needs to be a means to establish agreements electronically.

In connection with the advancement of ‘digital transformation’ activities, the means to provide a capacity for natural persons to engage with one-another to establish agreements that act to assist the parties in the management of their relationships via online systems, an agreements standard is required.  

This was initially considered to be embodied as ‘values credentials’, whereby the values (ie: human rights instruments based terms between parties) could be declared as to be supported between parties, irrespective of their nationality and/or physical location on earth. 

However, further consideration brought about a realisation that the transformation of ‘contracts’ electronically, has resulted in a normative practice method of applying agreements (ie: mandates) upon users, rather than providing support to better reflect the needs of parties involved in agreements.  

This thereby brought about the consideration that works on ‘value credentials’ would be better directed toward the establishment of an ‘agreement standard’ that could then be used to support both ‘values credentials’ (for managing relationships between people) as well as many other applications.

Asserted Agreements (“Mandates”) vs. Mutually Agreed Terms (Consensual Agreements)

There are two main types of agreements: asserted agreements and mutually agreed terms.

Asserted agreements are agreements that are imposed upon a party by another party. This can occur when a platform applies its terms of service upon a consumer, or when a government imposes regulations on businesses. In these cases, the party that is asserting the agreement has the power to dictate the terms of the agreement, and the other party has no choice but to accept them.

Mutually agreed terms are agreements that are negotiated between two or more parties. In these cases, all parties have an equal say in the terms of the agreement, and they must all agree to the terms before the agreement can be finalised. This type of agreement is often used when the parties have a common goal and they want to work together to achieve it.

There are a number of key differences between asserted agreements and mutually agreed terms.

- Power balance: In an asserted agreement, the party that is asserting the agreement has the power to dictate the terms of the agreement. In a mutually agreed terms agreement, all parties have an equal say in the terms of the agreement.  
    
- Flexibility: Asserted agreements are often less flexible than mutually agreed terms agreements. This is because the party that is asserting the agreement has the power to make changes to the terms without the consent of the other party. Mutually agreed terms agreements are more flexible because all parties must agree to any changes to the terms.  
    
- Managing Trust: Asserted agreements can sometimes create a sense of distrust between the parties. This is because the party that is asserting the agreement has the power to change the terms of the agreement without the consent of the other party. Mutually agreed terms agreements are more likely to support the management of trust between the parties because all parties have an equal say in the terms of the agreement, and are able to institute modifications and/or variations on an as-needed basis.  
    

## Problem Description

In general, the means to support the procedural requirements to establish mutually agreed terms agreements are preferable to asserted agreements. Whilst privacy policy / cookie requests, and the means to purchase goods from online shops provide some examples of existing agreements, the vast majority of online agreements do not provide the means for consumers to delegate terms of importance to them, and often these ‘terms of service’ and related forms of ‘mandates’ are readily updated.  Most users neither have much choice nor understanding of the implications of the electronic contracts that are sought to be applied upon them in a binding manner.  

The lack of a means to establish agreements via a process that supports the means for users to define mutually agreed terms, disaffects the ability to advance the development of modern ICT tools, services and related infrastructure.  This is a particularly significant problem for the advancement of Human Centric AI, and our means to address many ‘wicked problems’ in related fields of ICT.

Whilst the means to engage in a process whereby mutually agreed terms are able to be negotiated between parties without coercion can;

1. create a greater sense of trust between the parties, 
    
2. improve the binding nature of any terms in an agreement made and members of a mutually agreed terms based agreement, 
    
3. are more likely to be binding, as to support the maintenance of  responsibilities in relation to the terms of that agreement; and, as to support the means through which an agreement may be best employed, to achieve the desired outcome embodied by the agreement.
    

Online systems today do not have an agreed standard for providing support for mutually agreed terms based agreements.  The absence of this functionality disaffects our ability to create social web, and therefore also, interoperable, Human Centric AI Systems.  

An Agreements standard is needed.

In the context of Human Centric AI systems, they are recorded in an electronically form using RDF and cryptographic seals and/or signatures, as is defined via the W3C Credentials works. 
## SCOPE

Agreements can be established to support the considerations made by parties in relation to a wide range of topics, and may also be coupled to agreements that agents have made previously or are obligated to maintain for some reason, whether it be due to law & legislation, terms of agency pertaining to the circumstances of an agent or for a variety of other reasons.  Agreements may also be varied and involve multiple constituencies.

Defining the terms between users and/or entities is particularly important in relation to social-web based experiences, systems and related functionalities; that thereby help to define how the sharing of data should be managed, as is then supported via the implementation of supports via software agents (AI systems).  The absence of these mechanisms is believed to have a significant impact on the knowledge equity related economic structures that are currently supported via common-place ICT.

The ability for users to engage in processes to establish mutually agreed terms to Agreements is important both to establish the process in which consent be considered reasonably obtainable; and, because they help to ensure that all parties have the capacity to employ their human agency in defining the terms of an agreement with others.  

An Agreements standard would support the means for parties to have expressly stated in an electronic form that supports the comprehension of consensus between parties, so that all involved in any such agreement are on the same page and that they have a clear understanding of their rights, responsibilities and obligations. This can then be supported by software designed to support the means for a party to manage their agreements and related considerations, information & practices.

As agreements in electronic form are considered to be a form of contract. The practice of ensuring parties are able to mutually define proposed terms, which are then agreed upon the creation of the Agreement Instrument, is considered to be integral to address capability of consent related considerations that are critical to the establishment of a binding agreement between parties.

An Agreements standard is expected to help to prevent misunderstandings & conflicts whilst providing a necessary set of tools to support works that aim to support human rights via ICT.

## Social Web & Human Centric AI

Human Centric AI considers the means through which natural persons are provided tools to support the management of their own ‘personal ontology’ and/or electronic extension of self. This is considered imperative for the maintainability of human rights of persons, democracies & rule of law. 

The development of these capabilities requires both the means to support the personal management of information that is stored in a manner that is both machine and human readable (RDF, etc.), which leads to support for what has been considered to be termed the ‘social web’ and in future, the development of supports for human centric internet; and, through the employment of this apparatus, the functional requirements needed to support advanced, private and personal software agents (ai). 

A number of different types of agreements of importance for providing support for the development of Human Centric AI have been considered.  These include:

- Establishing & Managing Relationships: These agreements support the means through which Human Centric AI Agents; including but not limited to, personal AI agents, to understand the nature of the relationship between agents and therefore how to contextually support relationships and related information systems related dynamics between agents.  
    
- Data sharing agreements: These agreements define the terms and conditions for the sharing of data between multiple parties. They may specify the purpose of the data sharing, the types of data that can be shared, and the security measures that must be taken to apply terms in relation to the use and employment of the data.  
    
- Community Participation Agreements: These agreements define the scope, intents, capacities and process for managing the relationship between an agent and a community.  
      
    They may specify the scope of the role and capacity in which a participant engages with a community, provide information about responsibilities that can support software agent related automations (ie: notifications) and any procedural processes, practices, facilities and methods to address rights & responsibilities (including dispute resolution) in relation to the terms of the agreement.  
    
- Privacy agreements: These agreements may provide automation of user privacy settings in relation to the use of websites and online services. They may define the terms and conditions for the use of online websites and user data by online systems, services and websites.  
    
- Software Agreements: These agreements define the terms and conditions for the use of software systems.  For example; the permissions of an application on a mobile phone is provided by the user and/or legal guardian of the user.  
    
- Other agreements & Constituencies: There are many different use-cases associated with the practice of making, managing, maintaining and prosecuting rights in association to the use of agreements. Agreements may incorporate constituencies of terms that are applied upon all parties by law; whether the functionality of these considerations results in notifications or asserted rules, reporting procedures or other practices as may be reasonably required.
    
Agreements are an essential part of the Human Centric AI ecosystem. They help to ensure that all parties are on the same page and that they have a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities and are proposed as a method to manage the terms of personal relationships, as are then in-turn made employable by software agents on behalf of the natural agent (human beings).

## Technical Considerations and Methodologies.

### Use of W3C related Methods

The project known as Solid, incorporates the use of Credentials, RDF and other ‘semantic web’ components that provides the means to support machine readable documents, decentralised information systems, cryptographic signatures, interoperability between various ecosystems and the means to develop constituencies in a normalised format so that instruments can be reliably employed.

What is W3C Solid?

W3C Solid is a project that aims to create a more decentralised and user-centric web. It does this by giving users more control over their own data and by making it easier for them to share data with others.  It is considered to be the lead candidate for the production of a solution that can be used to ensure that any other Human Centric AI systems are exportable to a common underlying foundation.

How does W3C Solid work?

W3C Solid is based on the idea of a "solid pod." A solid pod is a personal data store that is controlled by the user. Users can store any type of data in their solid pod, including documents, photos, videos, and music.  Users are able to establish a multitude of ‘solid pods’.  Solid pods are hosted on servers that are owned and operated by the user. This gives users more control over their data and ensures that it is not subject to the whims of a third party.  The Solid Pod, manages the underlying data in a manner that means it is able to be used with any compatible application, with the same underlying data, subject to user-defined permissions, or perhaps in future - Agreements.

What are the benefits of W3C Solid?

There are many benefits sought to be achieved via the W3C Solid project, including:

- More control over your data: With Solid, you have complete control over your data. You can decide who can access your data, and you can set permissions to control how your data is used.
    
- Easier sharing of data: Solid makes it easy to share data with others. You can simply share your solid pod with someone else, and they will be able to access your data directly.
    
- Increased privacy: Solid is designed to protect your privacy. Your data is stored on servers that are owned and operated by you, and it is not subject to the whims of a third party.
    
- More interoperability: Solid is built on open standards, which makes it easy to integrate with other systems. This means that you can use Solid to access your data from any device or application.
    
- AI Foundations: Solid is designed to employ ‘semantic web’ systems and standards, which are the foundational for AI systems.
    

W3C Solid is a promising project that is the result of decades of work by dedicated humanitarian ICT professionals.  Advanced Human Centric AI systems requires a range of safeguards and safety protocols.  An area of importance therein, is ensuring that solutions are able to be made portable as to ensure a ‘Human Centric’ outcome is achieved.  Solid is considered to be the most likely candidate for providing that solution. Solid aims to revolutionise the way we think about data. By giving users more control over their own data, Solid can help to create a more decentralised and user-centric web.

Related W3C Standards & Emergent Works

The W3C Credentials standard provides a framework for issuing, verifying, and storing digital credentials. This standard can be used to create tamper-proof agreements that can be easily shared and verified.

The RDF (Resource Description Framework) standard provides a way to represent data in a structured way. This standard can be used to create machine-readable agreements that can be easily processed and analysed.

The SHACL (Shape Constraint Language) standard provides a way to define constraints on RDF data. This standard can be used to ensure that agreements are valid and complete.

Other Web and Semantic Web standards that can be used to create an agreements standard include:

- N3, Turtle, RDFa & JSON-LD: Various serialisation formats for representing RDF data.
    
- SPARQL: A query language for RDF data.
    
- RDFS & OWL: languages for representing ontologies.
    
- XSD: A language for defining XML schemas.
    
- CogAI: A W3C project that aims to produce Cognitive AI standards
    

These standards provide a solid foundation for creating an agreements standard that is interoperable, secure, and extensible.

### Value Credential Instruments

This project has grown from earlier Research and Development of Human Centric AI works, whereby the means through which persons form relationships with one-another, associates to a process whereby the use of ‘values credentials’ is employed when forming relationships, as is then able to be varied overtime to reflect changes to the relationship and any deprecated and/or maintained terms.  

These works are now proposed to be incorporated into the broader scope of defining an ‘agreements’ standard.  What this then also involves is the means to consider and support the progress of these prior works as a core component to the development of an W3C Standard for Agreements.
#### Support for the production of ‘Values Credentials’ instruments

There are many remarkable instruments that exist providing ethical, moral and legal frameworks to communicate expectations in a widely accepted set of terms and related frameworks. However, these instruments are often not described in a manner that is best equipped to support agreements with one-another. Some examples can be found: [https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-listings](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-listings)  whereby the instruments refer to inalienable human rights (natural rights) but the obligations are directed towards the state, rather than being directly employable for agreements between one-another.

There are many other examples where similar sorts of semantic problems are illustrated.  Somehow, works need to be supported as to establish paradigms through which these issues can be addressed.

#### Use Cases & User-Stories

There is a process of working through different use-cases which aids in the practices and processes for establishing standard that act to address the types of situations described by those use-cases.

User-Stories are more comprehensive outlines that may incorporate many embodied use-cases.

The production of use-cases is an important step towards the establishment of the terms and expectations for what the derivative technical process of defining a standards, is intended to address.
#### Express & Implied (enumerated) Terms

The production of a machine-readable agreements standard, defined using W3C Semantic Web related technologies, can provide the ability to define express terms, and implied semantics that are associated to implied terms.

This can then be employed as a means to process content and interactions via personal ai agents, to provide considerations about whether and/or how activities may have meaningful relationships to the status of agreements and/or any breaches.

Use-cases relating to the employment of these aspects, includes providing a means to manage deep-fakes or non-consensual distribution of intimate images and/or sensitive media.  

The practice, methods and processes involved in defining how these features should be made to work is expected to involve a process of engaging in workshops to process various considerations that are of importance; technically, socially, pragmatically and in relation to accessibility, rights and related considerations.

#### Related Considerations: Enforceability supports 

There are various considerations to be made about the importance of support for relevant electronic evidence standards and requirements; alongside, other temporal factors. 

Relationships change overtime, as such, these agreement standards should ensure support for temporal considerations in relation to the activities & related information.

Considerations about the scope of producing a W3C Agreement Standards & Related Works.

The process of defining a W3C standard for describing existing instruments, such as the UN Human Rights Instruments, in RDF with SHACL and related logical rules, and for the recommendation and accessibility standards considerations associated with the practice of supporting the process of negotiation of agreements; involves several key steps,

1. Gather Requirements:

- Identify the specific requirements and use cases for describing existing instruments in RDF.
    
- Identify the specific requirements and use cases for the agreement negotiation standard.
    
- Determine the necessary data elements, properties, and relationships to represent the instruments accurately.
    
- Determine the types of agreements that need to be supported, such as legal contracts, service level agreements, and privacy agreements.
    
- Define the functional and non-functional requirements for the standard, including security, privacy, and interoperability.
    
2. Develop a Conceptual Model:

- Create a conceptual model of the agreement negotiation process, including the roles of the parties involved, the steps in the negotiation process, and the data that needs to be exchanged.
    
- Define the semantics of the agreement terms using W3C Semantic Web standards such as RDF, RDFS, and OWL.
    
3. Develop an RDF Ontology:

- Create an RDF ontology that defines the concepts, classes, and properties required to describe the instruments.
    
- Ensure the ontology is aligned with existing standards and best practices, such as the W3C Semantic Web stack.
    

4. Develop Logical Rules:

- Define logical rules to express additional constraints and relationships that cannot be captured solely through the RDF ontology and SHACL shapes.
    
- These rules can be used to validate the data and ensure its consistency and integrity
    
5. Define SHACL Shapes:

- Use SHACL (Shape Constraint Language) to define shapes that validate the structure and content of RDF data.
    
- The shapes should ensure that the data conforms to the ontology and meets the specified requirements.
    

6. Design the Standard:

- Develop a technical specification for the agreement negotiation standard, including the syntax and semantics of the agreement terms, the protocols for negotiating and exchanging agreements, and the mechanisms for enforcing agreements.
    
- Ensure that the standard is interoperable with existing legal and regulatory frameworks.
    
7. Create a Test Suite:

- Develop a comprehensive test suite to validate the RDF ontology, SHACL shapes, and logical rules.
    
- Test the framework using real-world data to ensure its effectiveness and accuracy.
    
8. Seek Community Feedback:

- Share the draft standard with the W3C community and relevant stakeholders for feedback and comments.
    
- Incorporate feedback to refine the standard and address any identified issues.
    
9. Implement the Standard:

- Develop software and tools to implement the agreement negotiation standard, including libraries, frameworks, and applications.
    
- Test the implementation of the standard to ensure it meets the requirements and use cases.
    
10. Deploy the Standard:

- Publish the standard as a W3C Recommendation.
    
- Promote the adoption of the standard by industry and government organisations.
    
- Provide training and support for the use of the standard
    
11. Maintain the Standard:

- Monitor the use of the standard and gather feedback from users.
    
- Update the standard as needed to address new requirements and technologies.
    
- Ensure the standard remains interoperable with other relevant standards and regulations.
    
12. Finalise the Standard:

- After addressing the community feedback, finalise the standard by publishing it as a W3C Recommendation.
    
- The standard should provide clear guidelines and best practices for describing existing instruments in RDF with SHACL and related logical rules.
    

By following these steps, the process of defining a W3C standard for describing existing instruments in RDF with SHACL and related logical rules can be carried out in a rigorous, inclusive, and standards-compliant manner, as to develop a standard for agreement negotiation that is flexible, extensible, and interoperable. This standard can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agreement negotiation process, and it can also help to promote trust, probity and transparency in the digital economy.

Why W3C?

There are several reasons why W3C is an appropriate venue to support the development of these works:

- W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential by developing common protocols and standards that ensure the long-term growth and evolution of the Web. This mission is directly aligned with the goals of the Value Credential Instruments project, which aims to create a set of standards for describing and negotiating agreements in a way that is interoperable, secure, and extensible.  
    
- W3C has a long history of developing successful standards for the Web. These standards have helped to make the Web the open, global platform that it is today. W3C's experience and expertise in developing standards will be invaluable in the development of the Value Credential Instruments standard.  
    
- W3C has a diverse and international membership. This membership includes representatives from governments, industry, and academia. This diversity of perspectives will help to ensure that the Value Credential Instruments standard is developed in a way that meets the needs of all stakeholders.  
    
- W3C has a proven track record of working with other standards organisations. W3C has collaborated with other organisations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to develop standards that are widely adopted. This collaboration will be essential in the development of the Value Credential Instruments standard, which will need to be interoperable with other existing standards.
    
In addition to these reasons, W3C is also a neutral and impartial organisation. This neutrality is essential for the development of a standard that will be accepted by all stakeholders.  W3C's mission, experience, expertise, and membership and community group structures make it the perfect organisation to lead this important work.
