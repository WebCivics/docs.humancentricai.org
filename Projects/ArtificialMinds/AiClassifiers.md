There is a desire to form namonclature to better define different classes of 'Ai systems / agents'.

The purpose is to provide means to assist in considerations about the differences between different types of software agents / intelligent; and provide a means for people to more simply understand how the design of those systems may interact with interests of persons;
Equally, and somewhat more importantly also, as a means to consider how AI systems may be intentionally used to manipulate persons as to engender an outcome both upon the target; as well as having consequential implications upon others within or throughout communities.

There are a few considered implications; which need to be broadly considered through the development of different use-cases that may in-turn help to form and/or produce a series of requirements that somehow need to be addressed.  

Therein; is a notion of 'time' as is associated with a software agent vs. a natural agent, alongside various considerations associated to the optimisation of the use of energy whilst maintaining compliance and support for the statements set-out by the [[ValuesCredentials]].

This is in-turn considered to be part of the broader 'Explainable AI' series of considerations; that are in-turn linked both with the [[AgentLabelling]] issue, the [[SafetyProtocols]] issues in addition to an array of other projects that are expected to be communicated better shortly; yet most of all, it is considered to be a series of considerations that fall into the category of defining how it is we want to define and be defined by [[ArtificialMinds]].

### Global hive mind

Hive Mind:Â **An awareness formed from the communication of individual minds but different from each of its individual minds**, and so not defined by the separateness of the individual minds which compose it.
