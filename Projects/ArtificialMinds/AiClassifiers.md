This is a placeholder atm.

The field of this endevour and/or project concept, is to consider how the interests of persons may be better served by forming some sort of series of conventions or recommendations, in relation to the use of AI systems that have the effect of prioritising what persons are alerted to; and what they may consequentially find difficult to discover, find and/or be alerted to.

Equally, and somewhat more importantly; is the means to consider how AI systems may be intentionally used to manipulate persons as to engender an outcome both upon the target; as well as having consequential implications upon others within or throughout communities.

There are a few considered implications; which need to be broadly considered through the development of different use-cases that may in-turn help to form and/or produce a series of requirements that somehow need to be addressed.  

Therein; is a notion of 'time' as is associated with a software agent vs. a natural agent, alongside various considerations associated to the optimisation of the use of energy whilst maintaining compliance and support for the statements set-out by the [[ValuesCredentials]].

This is in-turn considered to be part of the broader 'Explainable AI' series of considerations; that are in-turn linked both with the [[AgentLabelling]] issue, the [[SafetyProtocols]] issues in addition to an array of other projects that are expected to be communicated better shortly; yet most of all, it is considered to be a series of considerations that fall into the category of defining how it is we want to define and be defined by [[ArtificialMinds]].
