# The Artificial Minds List

The Artificial Minds Index has been initially produced via a [Google Sheets Workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VixKXjZL31bZRXQS9J1FmvPyDzdkgE8B2-3fzPmRYNc/edit?usp=sharing) that is able to be publically edited / contributed to.. (i have backups). 

The information will be transferred to an improved online format, when time allows and/or if someone else is interested and has the time to do so.  

The point of the Artificial Minds Index, is to provide a communications tool or model that can be used socially and professionally; to engage in discussions about what sorts of artificial minds it is, that people and through them; organisations, are seeking to produce.  What sorts of qualities do they want to intentionally manufacture into some sort of man-made emboidment.  What sorts of features, designs, capabilities and impacts do those involved want to produce, and what sorts of considerations should be made about what to do if something goes wrong.  What if the things people design, cause serious harm to people; what if they operate in a manner that may act to generate profits / gainful incomes; but in a way that is known to be treating the statements made by various [[ValuesCredentials]], with contempt.


By considering the implications of how designs lead to real-world impacts; a means to  support the capacity for people to consider what sorts of [[ArtificialMinds]] they want to create and/or have influencing their experience of life; both for themselves and others.

IE: How will AI creations ensure they promote Informed decision making and consent.
