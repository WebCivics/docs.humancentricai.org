# Our Values

Web Civics activities seek to develop a somewhat unique [[CommunityOfPractice]] that works within a particular area, in a manner that is guided by the values set-out by [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments as have been provided via links in said note to the original articles. 

Furthermore, we make the continual undertaking to always make [[BestEfforts]], and to seek to ensure the tools that we seek to produce alone or with others are [[FitForPurpose]].

We seek to improve our capacity to deliver better tooling to support [[FairWorkProtocols]] and in-turn act to [[EndingDigitalSlavery]], whilst forming improved means to support people who work to produce better outcomes, instruments and tooling to support [[SafetyProtocols]], etc.
