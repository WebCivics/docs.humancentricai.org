## Intellectual Property

Intellectual property refers to the legal rights that protect the creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. These rights are intended to encourage innovation and creativity by allowing creators to control the use of their creations and to benefit from their exploitation.

There are several different types of intellectual property, including:

1.  Copyright: Copyright protects original works of authorship, such as literature, music, and artwork.
    
2.  Trademarks: Trademarks protect distinctive words, phrases, symbols, or designs that are used to identify and distinguish a particular product or service.
    
3.  Patents: Patents protect new and useful inventions, as well as certain types of discoveries and innovations.
    
4.  Trade secrets: Trade secrets protect confidential business information, such as recipes, formulas, and customer lists.

Intellectual property law is designed to balance the interests of creators and the public by granting certain exclusive rights to creators, while also allowing for the use and dissemination of ideas and information for the benefit of society.

## Web Civics Agreement.

The Copyright and Intellectual Property Agreement for Human Centric AI projects undertaken via this Web Civics community environment, is sought to be considered on a project-by-project basis; and may be subject to one of many different types of Agreements.  

In future; it is an objective that does in-turn support the [[WebCivicsCharter]] to seek to form apparatus that may act to better support [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] whilst simultaniously seeking to ensure that persons are both properly renumerated for useful [[KnowledgeWork]] in a defined and limited manner; as such, to ensure that works are neither subject to royalties or other financial dues in perpetuity; notwithstanding, the fair and necessary right for persons to be paid fairly for useful works that are the product of their time, choices & use of resources, whether it be their own or those of others who may have supported them to do good work.

As these systems do not exist, a compromise must be made.  The manner through which this is thought best applied at this stage, is to require persons involved in forming particular projects; to cooperatively define which of the following terms should be applied upon their group works.   These methodologies are sought to be updated and improved upon overtime.

It is considered that there are a few key areas of importance to be addressed as of now.

1. Other Peoples Intellectual Property and/or Intellectual Property Rights.
2. Copyright terms for works performed and/or contributed to these efforts.
3. Software Licensing Terms for works produced and/or contributors in connection with these efforts.

## 3rd Party Works.

Intellectual Property that is contributed for use by the community should be authorised by the copyright / moral owner of those works.  There is a duty to notify where this is not the case, and moreover it is preferred that any such activity is not done at all...  

Works produced by others should be clearly identified; both in terms of the known author, and/or any known or unknown aspects related to the provonance of the works and/or artifacts.

# Copyright

The Copyright Agreement for Human Centric AI projects undertaken via this Web Civics community environment, may be subject to one of many different types of Copyright Agreements.  The broader suggestion is that works develop to better support a dual-licensing methodology; this may in-turn act to better support the [[ValuesCredentials]] related considerations by being able to better address the needs of different cohorts that exist throughout our societies, without unnecessarily failing to consider the needs of people.

The three primary instruments that are intended to be employed at this stage; 

- [[CC_BY-NC-4.0-License]] - Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International
- [[CC_BY-SA-4.0-License]] - Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 InternationalÂ 
- [[CC_CC0-1.0-Universal]] - Public Domain Dedication No Attribution Required.

For projects where the objective is considered to be critical to [[ValuesCredentials]] related issues and the implications are such that it doesn't matter how something good happens to improve a situation, its just important that it happens - the Public Domain license, basically means the burden for having done what was required to make it and any consequential issues that may arise, is taken on by the creators; and the derivative works are made free.

The ShareAlike license is similar, yet the difference is that they must provide attribution; which may in-turn be something that they're able to remove if they elect to engage in-order to obtain a different license.  This is commonly used with photos and other media that may be distributed with this type of license, but the media contains a watermark or identifier.

The Attribution Non-Commercial is similar to the Attribution ShareAlike, but, the work is not licensed for the purpose of employing it for commercial purposes; but its free to use otherwise, so long as the consumer of it abides by the attribution terms of the license.

A list of other well-known licenses (particularly with respect to software) is made available via the [Open Source Initiative Here](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).
