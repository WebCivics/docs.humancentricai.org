 \n\n### ​Verifiability / Tamper Evidence vs. \"honour systems\"​\n\nPresently, there is no good method that is built into the technology ecosystem; that I am aware of.  In most cases involving actors whose behaviour is considered to be consistent with 'good', at the time, a solution to address this kind of issue may be something that is considered assistive and the natural person / legal entity will want to make use of it, rather than seeking to misrepresent the provenance of how the content was generated.  In these use cases there are also benefits associated with the ability to clearly denote responsibility in association to any mistakes that may have been made (without seeking to determine responsibility in relation to the effect any such instances may associate with).  This is also a common problem with AutoCorrect technologies that may only act to change a word; yet, the implication of that change may have a significant impact on the interpreted meaning of the document and/or artifact.\n\nIn other instances, the use of Software Agents may be employed far more comprehensively, and it has been shown that some agents have a capacity / propensity to 'make stuff up'[2] and this leads to one of many problems, such as the implication that these agents will at times create misinformation and disinformation. \n\nIn circumstances where an 'honour system' is being employed; the means to easily distinguish what parts were made by which agents, is a function or feature that is sought to be employed by the user / publisher / creator / disseminator of the content / artifact.  Yet this is not always the case - either - in relation to a natural or legal agent on a common or contextual basis.   There are complex social factors that play a meaningful role in seeking to determine an appropriate solution in this area and it may well be the case that there is a large volume of work that would need to be done to mitigate risks related to any misguided and/or misappropriated attempts to pervert the ability to create a solution that is helpful, and does not unnecessarily or disproportionately exert power and/or influence over the use of these sorts of tools.  \n\nThereafter; the greater challenge appears to be to define methods that may support tamper-evidence of artifacts and/or strengthened informatics that provides support for determining the provenance of electronic documents and/or artifacts where the agent is seeking to intentionally deceive and/or mislead the recipient and/or observers.  These sorts of use-cases may apply to institutions of public trust as much as they may also apply to persons engaged in cybercrime.   The implications are not merely related to Ai Agents such as the now publically well known and advanced systems that are increasingly celebrated;

via systems that are private, personal and associated with that natural person, much like a significantly enhanced electronic calculator...   In other instances, large institutions may seek to operate their businesses using advanced designs of software agents to successfully operate their business and mitigate risks via designs that make use of software agents.  one example of these sorts of situations i describe as #NoBodyAI - whereby the notion is, that designs are produced that are intended to have the effect of mitigating risks in a manner where if 'found out' it is intended that any repercussive effects are simply put down to a 'software glitch' or similar, and that no-body (person / legal entity) is responsible. #NoBodyAi.\n\n### Societal Benefit of AI.  \n\nThere are various challenging issues that through the course of my work and related research, I have sought to figure out methods that were not immediately obvious to me, as to address those problems.  Commonly this has involved speaking with the government.  In some of these problem domains, issues are set aside and a great deal of effort (energy / resources) are applied towards the objective purpose of seeking to 'do nothing' (commonly known as 'bureaucracy', which appears to me to be a very kind interpretation when considered in relation to some areas of purposefully good pursuits).  The introduction of Large-Scale AI services brings about an opportunity for persons who would otherwise not be capable of resolving problems that may relate to matters of great importance;
