Certainly, the idea that such forms of work should be exploited and punitively discouraged; whilst actively promoting and endorsing via transactional activity those who gainfully do the opposite, certainly brings with it an array of implications.\n\n*ideologies that are not compatible with [[WebCivicsCharter]] or related instruments...*\n\nThe applied consideration; Is to support a framework where all forms of [[ProjectFinancing]] are treated equally.  That is, that if unpaid or funded work is undertaken by someone and the useful derivatives of that contribution are useful; then, they're treated in the same way as any other investor - subject to an array of particular terms, to better contextualise the nature of the circumstance, etc.  This seeks to engender rules that basically act to support 'good faith relations' in a manner that attends to the intended meaning fo the statements outlined by the [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments,  structurally.\n\nThereafter, there is an array of [[ContributionClassifications]] that are importantly defined which then have implications on the [[WorkValuationMethods]] and in-turn also, the licensing frameworks.  \n\nThere are an array of [[SocialAttackVectors]] that will directly target these constituencies of the ecosystem.  It is important that there are both clear rules and systems in place to address disputes.  The [[LicensingFrameworks]] will be particularly attentive to circumstances in which works relate to the fundemental rights of Human Beings (ie: Core [[ValuesCredentials]] ); and will distinguish between natural persons (human beings), organisations with reduced means vs. users who are enterprise, large corporations, Government and other similar sorts of entities whose nature is different and that there is a capacity to form licensing frameworks for those types of users in a manner that distinguishes their obligations differently to those of others. \n\nThis type of mechanism is intended to provide the means to support [[KnowledgeWork]] compensation for the development and creation of tooling that is required to support the foundational requirements of tooling relating to the Peace Infrastructure Project in a manner that seeks compensatory revenues (income) from organisations; whom, for example, may be defined as having a cash flow of above $3m AUD Per Annum or by way of structural identity frameworks (ie: in circumstances where analysis is not feasible); as may be determined; whilst,\n\n*Providing the derivative tooling free of charge to all other users.*  \n\nIn other circumstances; where the work-derivative is some sort of 'optional' `#thing` then the cost may be collected from all users at some rate defined by the projects leaders; but that, the overall compensatory amount is sought to be built upon a fixed return for the total effort calc (ie: [[ProjectFinancing]] ); for whatever that body of work is defined as being.  In some cases, work will continue to provide new versions and/or additional maintainence and support for whatever that thing is; which in-turn, ends-up being attributed to the economic frameworks associated with that thing.\n\nWhilst conceptually supported; yet not at all the focus at present, if someone invents something that is entirely optional, as in - its a market based product that might be distinct, yet, a persons life (ie: [[ValuesCredentials]] ) are not going to be disaffected by not having it; then, whoever sells it is entirely entitled to seek to charge whatever they want; and if people want to pay for it, that's really upto them.  as they say 'its a free market'; yet, these sorts of considerations do not apply to works that are critical for Peace Infrastructure Project related purposes.  \n\n**Donations**: if people want to make donations or gift to persons above and beyond the project related economic protocols; that's ok, but also not sought to be required.\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.","excerpt":"The Work Project The 'Work Project' has a multitude of constituencies, and is basically motivated by a desire to prioritise [ EndingDigital…","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"h1\", {\n    \"id\": \"web-civics-charter\"\n  }, \"Web Civics Charter\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The Web Civics Charter is being defined to provide an outline of what is expected of persons and what persons should expect, when being involved in any Web Civics Project, including but not limited to the communities that have been established to support the positive development of Human Centric AI technologies, policies, recommendations, communities and all such related activities and works.\"), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"guiding-principles--instruments\"\n  }, \"Guiding principles & Instruments\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The primary objects that are employed to define expectations with respect to how we are sought to honourably support the welfare, rights and responsibilities that are inextricably linked to our means to support progress in a manner that uplifts human dignity for ourselves, one-another and those who may be impacted by the consequences of our thoughtful behaviours, is defined by way of the \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"/WebCivicsCharter/OurValues/ValuesCredentials/\",\n    \"title\": \"ValuesCredentials\"\n  }, \"ValuesCredentials\"), \".
