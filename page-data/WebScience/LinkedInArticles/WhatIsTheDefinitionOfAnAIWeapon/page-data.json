dangers of '[AI Weapons](http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter_autonomous_weapons)', I was looking for some feedback on what would be defined as an 'AI Weapon'...\n\nBasic Research says, common terms talk of '[arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race)'[2], '[weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon)'[3], yet perhaps distinctions reasonably relate to any form of '[warfare](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/warfare)'[4], whether that be '[economic warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_warfare)'[5], perhaps '[information warfare'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare)[6] or perhaps more explicitly, conventional warfare or other acts of [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War) [7] generally....\n\nYet, from a laypersons point of view, a weapon seems more like something that can be used to harm or control another by way of act or threats of acting as to utilise the 'weapon'...\n\nFactors of self-defence are also important to consider.  In-turn, at least from a philosophical point of view, far more complex issues in-turn come to mind, such as [the statistics on police shootings in different regions](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries) \n\nSo, at the risk of reading far too deeply into the work that has been promoted via various news networks, World-Wide; I've posted my first thing on linked-in, seeking the input of others who consider the merits of the aforementioned open-letter in the broader sense, and therein seek your views. \n\nWithin the field of work for which i am involved, some of the Questions I ponder, relates to both storage and in-turn how systems enable the use of agents[8], pending their distinction (what sort of 'agent' they are).  \n\n-   How non-human agents are made capable?\n-   How should they be shut down if necessary?\n\nand perhaps implicitly, pursuant to some of
