Arrest and charging: If the suspects are identified and there is sufficient evidence to support charges, the next step is typically to arrest the suspects and charge them with the appropriate crimes.\n    \n4.

Trial: If the case is not resolved through pre-trial proceedings, it will typically proceed to trial, where the prosecution will present its case and the defense will present its case.\n    \n6.
