Github: \n\ta. A user needs to set-up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. \n\tb. then they need to set-up a github repo to publish their documents #website \n\tc. The user then needs to set-up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Make sure you set the pages link to the gh-pages branch.  Decide whether you want to use the github provided address or add a cname to the dns records of your domainname, sync and add ssl.\n\td. Then they need to download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/) and clone the repo to a local storage location.\n\n2. Download and install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n\n3. Obsidian Gatsby Website Template.\n\te. I've used the [Obsibian Template for Gatsby Theme Primer Wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/)goto the link and download the zip file.\n\tf. upzip the files and copy to the local directory you've created using GitHub Desktop. Then goto GitHub Desktop and right click on the project - selecting the option 'open in visual studio code'\n\tg. edit the ```.layouts/gatsby-config.js``` file to replace the information entered about the author of the template, with the information about your own project / site then save.\n\th. goto ```.layouts/static``` and edit the ```CNAME``` file with your own information then save; and then, create a logo and replace ```logo.png```.\n\t\t\n4. Download and install Obsidian\n\ta. Once obsidian is installed, a screen will come-up and one of the options will be to 'open folder as vault'.  Do that, and find the folder that you've created using github desktop for the gatsby files.  Open it. \n\n\tb. you should now see a list of the existing content that came with the website template.  You can either delete all those files or manage them in some way useful to you.  (ie: create a directory and put it those files into it, etc ).  Then start using obsidian to create your own files.\n\t\n\tObsidian automatically saves files.  \n\t\n5. Publish or Publish Draft\n\tWhen you're ready, go back to github desktop and you should see that your project has a bunch of updates. In Github Desktop, goto the repo (project) create a 'commit' by providing a summary and description, then d hit 'commit to main'; and push the 'pull' button. \n\t\n\tIf you get an error with  ```workspace.json``` right click and add to .gitignore. \n\t\n\ta. Current Branch: Main - The main branch will build the application, and publish it to gh-pages. \n\tb. drafts: if you want to save your draft, but not publish it - try creating a different branch. \n\t\n\tNOTE: GIT has a learning curve.  I've had some difficulties with it, and i'm still working on it. \n\n\nhope that helps! \n\n**NOTE:** I have had some difficulty with syncing. I have found at times, that work appears to have dissappeared.  In-turn also, i've had challenges with git and git-stash requirements, which has led me to figure out how to find files (work) that have 'gone'; and then go and recover it.  \n\nput simply, you've got to goto the git system files and look at the log; then find the hash for the stash that's been lost; and goto command prompt and type in git branch (name of branch - ie: recovered) and then the hash.  Then after its been recovered, there's a process to merge back with the original files.\n\nWhilst the method explained above is intended to be useful; it may also be better, to keep the local docs seperate from docs uploaded to github: so basically, write the docs in obsidian and store your work in progress in a folder somewhere; then, when you want to upload it - copy those files to the github folder location, overwriting old files.  \n\nThe other issue that i've had is that HTML in files can break gatsby; so, in the github actions section (online in github) you'd need to look at what might have gone wrong if the build fails & then fix it. \n\nI'm therefore thinking about how to apply [[EarlyStageIncomeStrategies]] type concepts to get help for people, although i'm not entirely sure how to do that yet. \n\nIn anycase; that's how this development documentation has been produced for the [devdocs.webizen.org](https://devdocs.webizen.org) site.\n\n\n### NOTES\n\n1. Whilst not exhaustive - [issues](https://github.com/WebizenAI/devdocs/issues) are being logged via github. \n2. The DocumentHeading can be overridden by creating a top level Heading\n3.

Consequently, these ‘mainframe’ like - money first policy framework, engenders a form of moral poverty that is, to me, simply detestable.  \n\nI hear from staff members of politicians offices; who suggest, nothing i’ve done has impacted ‘government policy’, whilst the fools are logging into systems that are being developed to in-part depend upon infrastructure that i was involved in creating, globally.  Yet, in my opinion, this isn’t about honesty, its about violence.  Systems that act violently as to in-turn prevoke violence, as the underlying series of assumptions are built upon the acceptability and barriers engendered to limit lawful recourse when persons are disaffected by [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]].  Whilst an extrodinary amount of effort may well see a person be able to have a problem that has been disaffecting them addressed; often, the apparent belief is that any such adjustment should in and of itself be considered lawful remedy, regardless of the broader repercussions any such wrongs may have had upon the target of wrong-doings and/or the intentional employment of [[SocialAttackVectors]] because of how AI is designed to support some [[SafetyProtocols]] without any form of meaningful support for others, including some of those defined already in these documents. \n\n*Notably also; During the course of my R&D works in relation to these ecosystems, it has been made apparent to me that they are less likely to engage in wrong-doing when dealing with professional criminals.  It has been suggested to me, that they prefer to target law abiding citizens because its far easier than targeting criminals, who have advanced their skills as a requirement relating to their profession as a criminal. In-effect, that they’re too hard to sort out; so, they go after the good actors, who they know, they can assault without consequence because - they’re good actors, unwilling to break the law regardless of how it is these people, assault our values, as a society overall.*   \n\nSo.  \n\n### Defining 'Human-Centric Ai Ethics'\n\nThe implication for defining “Human Centric Ai Ethics’ relates to [[WebScience]] considerations; when modelling [[ArtificialMinds]] as to support ‘reality check tech’. Human Centric AI is for those who want to build solutions that improve our capacity to sort out bad actors via courts; via the production of solutions that provide ‘democratisation’ of electronic evidence. This in-turn supports foundational requirements considered necessary in-order to support the ability to do real-world ‘ai ethics’ in ways that was previously impossible as a consequence of designs. \n\nThe Founder of Web Civics is actively working on an HumanCentricAI ecosystem solution implementation that is called Webizen.\n\n![[webizen.jpg]]\n\nWebizen systems are different to modern global cloud 'Mainframes', that are built to support the requirements of rulers - not rights, human rights or other words; has nothing to do with ‘ethics’ in a world, that is said to be about building peace infrastructure.  Yet whilst he continues to progress this long-term project that has had such a big role in defining his life, the underlying purpose of the works - is all about the sorts of things described by in the instruments referred to in the [[ValuesCredentials]]  documentation; whilst the now global [credentials](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) work that is often said to be 'digital identity', that is a derivative of works [he helped to establish](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) sadly, those who became prompted to leadership roles; never quite got to the point where many of the usecases related to [[SafetyProtocols]] including but not limited to [[ValuesCredentials]] were just not part of what ended-up being globally implemented as ID.\n\nIn consideration; \n\n*This video below provides a very quick summary of the difference between rights and rulers.*\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRGhrYmUjU4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n### Economic Benefits of Ethics for Moral Economy Systems\n\nSystems, that are designed to support acts of violence with legal impunity, due to structure of systems designs; and other political-sciences related manoeuvres, don’t cost less. Rather, there is a propensity to engender or employ various types of [[SocialAttackVectors]] in an effort to negate responsibility for whatever the underlying problem actually is; terms that describe these sorts of behaviours include \"passing the buck\" and obstruction.  Innately, these sorts of behaviours incur additional costs whilst failing to deliver an outcome that needs to be resolved in some way, even if the outcome that is engendered is that the victim ends-up dead.  When these sorts of things are exacted upon persons, it has a ripple effect across a multitude of persons, and overall - doesn't improve productivity, support human rights or increase the capacity for gainful revenues to become developed via the success of policies relating to [[SafetyProtocols]], [[ValuesCredentials]], [[WebScience]] or various other measures.\n\n## What is Ethics? \n\nIn the diagram, produced in 2018, as provided below; the distinction between 'moral responsibility' and 'ethical responsibility' is illustrated. \n\n![[2018-9TheCollectiveInfoSphere.webp]]\n\n![[1_iGzdEyUWAzT7TDjU6IUvTQ.webp]]\n\n\nTherein - the distinction becomes one where every individual human being owns the moral responsibility that is associated to his or her actions; yet, in a group situation, the utility of that moral responsibility to make their own personal choices in any given situation may not result in an outcome that is consistant with their view; as such, the prevailing outcome is considered to be the representation of a groups ethical responsibilities. \n\nAs a consequence of there being very little support for individuals (or indeed also, lawful remedy in relation to wrong-doings); there are various distortive effects upon 'ethics' generally, and in-turn also those that relate to the creation of active software agents, that we manifestly call - Artificial Intelligence or AI.  \n\n## HumanCentricAI Differences\n\nThrough the use or application of 'AI Ethics' in relation to HumanCentricAI ecosystems, ‘ethics’ or various values statements that are said to be the guiding instruments bound to their terms of employment; are in-turn subject to semantic ecosystems that ensure they’re not provided the right to assault the human rights of children, or their loved ones as to exploit children. \n\nActions that may be considered to be part of a persons authorised behaviours in connection with an employment contract that may seek otherwise, to provide impunity without insurable (or uninsurable) risk / liability - becomes contextualised via the ability of others to seek lawful consideration via courts of law.  \n\nSo the benefit, of HumanCentricAI for people who actually care about ‘ethics’ or moral equities, socio-economic systems, solutions and the means to use technology as a series of tools to support the interests of our human family; is that through means, to democratise ‘ai servers’ so that there’s a means to include, consideration for natural justice, for the needs, rights, values and considerations of importance for natural persons, in their private capacity; regardless of any other role they may hold in our societies, that there’s now a technical means to figure out how it is, we’re able to make them more meaningful than before.\n\nAs such, new opportunities become available to form more appropriate approaches that can better support the common understanding of what terms like 'ethics' should mean, particularly in relation to public policy and related (endorsed) public / private sector activities.\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/","title":"Projects"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Projects folder contains some information about existing projects that are being undertaken or considered or have simply been fortunate enough to be added to the documentation at this stage; as i go about setting up the documentation website.\n\nThe Founder of this site is also undertaking an array of works that relate to this field, but are presently defined as being independent.  In particular, this includes the works on the [Webizen AI Ecosystem](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) which incorporates works to produce what has been called [Permissive Commons](https://devdocs.webizen.org/PermissiveCommons/).  As the Webizen AI systems are unlicensed at this stage, the development of this [[HumanCentricAI]] web civics initiative seemed like a usefully positive idea.\n\nThere are a few shared objectives that exist, and have therefore been added to the projects folder.  \n\nThe First is a project that was started now sometime ago; that was simply seeking to create some materials to support communicators who are looking to talk about [[ArtificialMinds]] and in-turn support considerations and deliberations about what it is the group seeks to achieve.\n\nThe Second, is an initiative to look at [[AgentLabelling]] with a view to seeking to produce a set of methods, specifications and marks that support the means for willing operators to support the idea of seeking to ensure that observers / consumers / users, are able to be made aware of when and how AI is playing some sort of role in their observations and/or experiences; both online and offline. \n\nThe Third is a project that's led by a W3C CG to produce an open-standard for [[CognitiveAI]]. \n\nThe Fourth is about the production of [[SafetyProtocols]] that are designed to support [[ValuesCredentials]] related rights and principals, and in-turn address [[SocialAttackVectors]].\n\nOne of those issues that is of particular importance in my mind, is to ensure that works are defined as to make progress towards [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] and one of the aspects related to achieving progress in that area is in-turn the [[WorkProject]].\n\nFinally, \n\nThe creation of this community engagement initiative is in-turn also a fairly significant undertaking in and on its own.

Yet, the underlying issue is considered to be a fairly old issue.  Whether it be the minor 'autocorrect errors' that most have experienced with text messages or other apps; or whether it be, what might become very serious errors in spreadsheets & other important records and/or documents; the ability to ensure there is a means to comprehend who is responsible for what, where, when; has a variety of important ramifications that should be considered and better supported.  This is not unlike accessibility standards now commonplace throughout society whether it be in relation to our civic infrastructure or our online systems and their interfaces on the web, television and otherwise.  \n\nMore broadly, of the importance of providing information about the agent responsible for content associated with (electronic) communiations is becoming increasingly important.  \n\nThis is one of the many considerations that led me to producing these WebCivics - Human Centric AI community works. \n\nMy initial considerations are provided via the notes below.\n\n\n### Problem definition:\n\nAI agents have played a role in the communication between natural persons and other natural persons and/or legal entities via electronic communications for some time.   Most people are familiar with the problems caused merely via autocorrect issues, yet the implications of software agents is becoming more pronounced.\n\nWhilst there are many positive benefits of software agents, there are also risks. \n\nSome of those risks relate to whether or not an observer is able to distinguish between whom or what it is that has produced correspondence or other communications and related derivatives.\n\n### Agent Labelling concept:\n\nThe agent labelling concept is an initiative that seeks to define a technical method to enunciate in a human & machine readable manner what type of agent is responsible for any part of a communicated message.  Messages or content may be wholly or partially generated by a software agent, interactivity with natural & legal agents. \n\nSoftware agents have different classifications and often also names.\n\nIn some mediums these semantics can be illustrated using rdf.  In other circumstances it may be labelled using metadata or even a specific font that by default enables the consumers or observers of content for whom a response is sought to be elicited may thereby be provided information about the provenance of how the information has been generated.   \n\nIn some cases multiple software agents may be involved in the creation of a document or artifact transmitted to others.\n\n## Agent labelling considerations;  \n\n### ​Verifiability / Tamper Evidence vs. \"honour systems\"​\n\nPresently, there is no good method that is built into the technology ecosystem; that I am aware of.  In most cases involving actors whose behaviour is considered to be consistent with 'good', at the time, a solution to address this kind of issue may be something that is considered assistive and the natural person / legal entity will want to make use of it, rather than seeking to misrepresent the provenance of how the content was generated.  In these use cases there are also benefits associated with the ability to clearly denote responsibility in association to any mistakes that may have been made (without seeking to determine responsibility in relation to the effect any such instances may associate with).  This is also a common problem with AutoCorrect technologies that may only act to change a word; yet, the implication of that change may have a significant impact on the interpreted meaning of the document and/or artifact.\n\nIn other instances, the use of Software Agents may be employed far more comprehensively, and it has been shown that some agents have a capacity / propensity to 'make stuff up'[2] and this leads to one of many problems, such as the implication that these agents will at times create misinformation and disinformation. \n\nIn circumstances where an 'honour system' is being employed; the means to easily distinguish what parts were made by which agents, is a function or feature that is sought to be employed by the user / publisher / creator / disseminator of the content / artifact.  Yet this is not always the case - either - in relation to a natural or legal agent on a common or contextual basis.   There are complex social factors that play a meaningful role in seeking to determine an appropriate solution in this area and it may well be the case that there is a large volume of work that would need to be done to mitigate risks related to any misguided and/or misappropriated attempts to pervert the ability to create a solution that is helpful, and does not unnecessarily or disproportionately exert power and/or influence over the use of these sorts of tools.  \n\nThereafter; the greater challenge appears to be to define methods that may support tamper-evidence of artifacts and/or strengthened informatics that provides support for determining the provenance of electronic documents and/or artifacts where the agent is seeking to intentionally deceive and/or mislead the recipient and/or observers.  These sorts of use-cases may apply to institutions of public trust as much as they may also apply to persons engaged in cybercrime.   The implications are not merely related to Ai Agents such as the now publically well known and advanced systems that are increasingly celebrated; but also, as noted earlier, AutoCorrect functions and in-turn also, even spreadsheets.  Whilst any useful solution may not simply be defined via technological standards, but rather an ecosystem approach that might employ both public and/or 'platform' policy in addition to technological tools (methods), the challenge in these latter use cases is complicated by the underlying social factors considering the circumstances whereby the user (transmitter, etc.) expressly does not want there to be a means to distinguish between the work of a software agent and that of their own making (although the two are loosely coupled). \n\n### Types of Software Agents;\n\nnot all software agents are the same.  Different software agents have different qualities, traits and 'relations' / implications.  Natural persons (may) employ software agents as a personal aid; via systems that are private, personal and associated with that natural person, much like a significantly enhanced electronic calculator...   In other instances, large institutions may seek to operate their businesses using advanced designs of software agents to successfully operate their business and mitigate risks via designs that make use of software agents.  one example of these sorts of situations i describe as #NoBodyAI - whereby the notion is, that designs are produced that are intended to have the effect of mitigating risks in a manner where if 'found out' it is intended that any repercussive effects are simply put down to a 'software glitch' or similar, and that no-body (person / legal entity) is responsible. #NoBodyAi.\n\n### Societal Benefit of AI.  \n\nThere are various challenging issues that through the course of my work and related research, I have sought to figure out methods that were not immediately obvious to me, as to address those problems.  Commonly this has involved speaking with the government.  In some of these problem domains, issues are set aside and a great deal of effort (energy / resources) are applied towards the objective purpose of seeking to 'do nothing' (commonly known as 'bureaucracy', which appears to me to be a very kind interpretation when considered in relation to some areas of purposefully good pursuits).  The introduction of Large-Scale AI services brings about an opportunity for persons who would otherwise not be capable of resolving problems that may relate to matters of great importance; including but not exclusive to the human rights of persons, to be supported in seeking to form methods to address those problems.\n\nThese types of circumstances may lead to frictions, between historical and/or traditional barriers and the statements, purpose and considerations made by law and/or other legal and/or ethical/moral contracts and constructs (ie: codes of conduct that are defined and employed in a manner that is consistent with basic legal principles, as are often defined by human rights related instruments, etc.).  This is assumed to be particularly beneficial for persons whose subsistence is experienced in poverty; and that, meaningful assistance by competent professionals has simply not been materially available and/or accessible; and that, in extraordinary circumstances where that may not be the case, these resources may be easily redirected at low cost.  Therein, whilst any such circumstances of poor behaviour may not be consistent with law, if it is never able to be heard - many consider any such approach to be acceptable (ie: risk management);  now therefore, the implication becomes one whereby the introduction of advanced software agents - significantly impacts the broader circumstances.  This is also particularly the case for persons who are considered (rightly or wrongly) to require some sort of advocate and/or guardian, whose statements are said to be unreliable.   Whilst some may seek the same qualities to be built into software, as to allay any threat of exposure that may come about otherwise; these sorts of complex considerations, may also be an important part of a scope of works that considers how to define a more complex approach for agent labelling that acts to prioritize human rights above wrongs, irrespective of the inconvenience that may engender upon some who may seek to be successful via the employment of solutions that represent a different kind of structure.\n\n[2] https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cogai/2023Jan/0009.html\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/ArtificialMinds/","title":"Artificial Minds"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Artificial Minds\n\n## Introduction\nThe somewhat social concept of how one might think about Artificial Intelligent agents and in-turn systems, like OpenAI and in-turn also 'webizen', is that they're a form of artificial mind.

Current work is being undertaken via [[CognitiveAI-WIP]] notes.\n\nCognitive artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of AI that is designed to mimic the cognitive abilities of humans, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language processing. It is based on the idea that the human brain is a computational system that can be emulated by a machine, and it seeks to build AI systems that can perform tasks that require human-like cognition.\n\nCognitive AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, and machine vision, which allow machines to learn from data, understand and generate human language, and perceive and understand the visual world in a way that is similar to humans. These technologies can be applied in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, education, and customer service, to assist humans in making decisions, providing personalized recommendations, and completing tasks more efficiently.\n\nHowever, cognitive AI also raises ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for automation to displace human workers, the need for transparency and explainability in AI decision-making, and the potential for AI to perpetuate and amplify biases present in the data used to train it. As a result, the development and use of cognitive AI requires careful consideration of these issues and the responsible design and deployment of these technologies.\n\n### UseCases\n\nSome of the initial use-cases for CogAI will include the TheValuesProject and in-turn therein,  the ability to process a multitude of [[ValuesCredentials]] and in-turn provide support for Webizen Owners to evaluate whether and/or how an activity may be compliant, compatible and/or promotional of those values or whether and how there may be some sort of conflict.  \n\n### Requirements\nThere must be an open-standards way to perform these sorts of procedural knowledge representation tasks.  This will in-turn support productivity and reduce and/or clarify risks associated with behaviours and/or activities.\n\nThe Area has an array of very complex requirements; however fundamentally, the Web Science related requirement, is to figure out how to form a #HumanCentric Approach; so that, whilst the tools may offer suggestions and/or support, it is fundamentally still only humans that are responsible for making decisions and not Active Artificial Agents ( #AI )\n\n### W3C Cognative AI CG \nWork to produce an open-standard for Cognative AI is being undertaken now in the [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \n\n\"The real world is frustratingly uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent. This is challenging for traditional approaches to information systems, and a new paradigm is needed that combines symbolic and statistical techniques, building upon decades of work in the cognitive sciences, and over 500 million years of natural selection. This will allow us to create cognitive agents that learn and reason based upon prior knowledge and past experience, and which can satisfy the need for, transparency in decision making, and continuous learning for adapting to ever changing needs. This community group will address opportunities for cognitive agents using graphs, statistics, rules and graph algorithms, starting with an amalgam of RDF and Property Graphs, together with Web architecture for cognitive databases.\"\n\nSource:  [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \nLICENSING: The [W3C CogAI Contributor Agreement is defined HERE](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/)\n\nNote also the GitHub link for the [CogAI](https://github.com/w3c/cogai/).\n\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/KnowledgeQualificationMethods/","title":"Knowledge Qualification Methods"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Knowledge Qualification Methods\n\nThe advent of AI, is far more significant than the implications of the time where caculators became easily accessible. \n\nI've asked OpenAI / ChatGPT the following;\n\nWhat are some practical courses of action that could assist educators in seeking to evaluate whether a student understands a topic or subject that they've been required to study, but may have used an AI program to produce a written report that is submitted - without necessarily understanding what it is the activity was intended to support the students ability to learn about and gain knowledge about, the topic. What sorts of activities could be undertaken to evaluate whether or not a student has gained knowledge about the topic, rather than more simply, having used an AI program to provide reports that may pass traditional tests without the student necessarily understanding or gaining knowledge of the topic, subject and/or related concepts.?\n\nThere are several practical courses of action that educators can take to evaluate whether a student understands a topic or subject that they've been required to study, even if they have used an AI program to produce a written report. Here are a few examples:\n\n1.  Oral or written questioning: One effective way to evaluate understanding is through oral or written questioning. The educator can ask the student to explain or summarize key concepts or ideas related to the topic, or to provide examples of how they apply the knowledge in a specific scenario.\n    \n2.  Hands-on activities: Another way to evaluate understanding is through hands-on activities such as problem-solving exercises, lab experiments, or group projects. These activities allow the student to demonstrate their understanding of the topic in a practical setting.\n    \n3.  In-class participation: Educators can observe and evaluate the student's level of understanding through in-class participation, such as group discussions, debates, or presentations. Through this, the educators can see the level of engagement and understanding of the student.\n    \n4.  Self-reflection and feedback: Educators can ask the students to reflect on their learning process and provide feedback on the effectiveness of the learning methods they have used. Through this, the educators can evaluate if the student has gained knowledge about the topic or not.\n    \n5.  Peer evaluation: Educators can also ask students to evaluate each other’s understanding of the topic, this can be done through a peer review or through small group discussions, where students can identify areas of misunderstanding and help one another to understand the topic better.\n    \n6.  Use of Authentic Assessment: Educators can use tasks that are similar to what students may encounter in the real world, this allows students to apply their understanding of the topic in more meaningful and relevant context, thus evaluating the real understanding.\n    \n\nIt's worth mentioning that this list is not exhaustive, and that each educator should choose the approach that they think is the best fit for the specific subject, students, and context. Additionally, a combination of several of these methods might yield more accurate results.\n\nAnother approach educators can take is to design assessments that are difficult for AI software to complete, for example, assessments that require students to integrate or apply multiple pieces of information, or that require creativity, critical thinking, or complex problem-solving skills. Such assessments are more likely to be difficult for AI software to complete as they are not based on simple pattern recognition, but on sophisticated abilities that are characteristic of human intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating more open-ended questions that require students to provide explanations or to justify their reasoning can also be an effective way to evaluate whether students have a deep understanding of the topic, rather than just recognizing patterns in the text.\n\nIn addition to these approaches, educators can also use plagiarism detection software to identify instances where students have used AI to produce written reports without understanding the topic. However, it is important to note that plagiarism detection software is not a foolproof method, as it can only detect text that has been copied and pasted from other sources, not text that has been generated by AI.\n\nFinally, Educators should also be aware of their own role in fostering the critical thinking and understanding of the students, by providing clear learning objectives, providing appropriate resources and providing opportunities for feedback and continuous improvement."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/PermissiveCommons/","title":"Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Permissive Commons\n\nPermissive Commons is thought of as a form of technology due to the requirement for a specification to be defined in-order for it to be made to work harmonously online.\n\nEarlier writings about the concept have included, the article first published online around 2018: [[the-need-for-decentralised-open-linked-data]] which was followed by 2 others in 2019,\n- [[OpenDatav3.0PermissiveCommons]]\n- [[TechforPermissiveCommons]]\n\nMore work is being done to produce an implementation of these systems, namely via the [Webizen](https://devdocs.webizen.org/PermissiveCommons/) works; although not necessarily exclusively.  There are some complexities that are sought to be worked through, and is considered in-part to be a Web Civics project (although required for the Webizen Ecosystem to work); and in-turn, instrumental for [[HumanCentricAI]].\n\nNotes otherwise Below.\n\n\n![[webizen_diagram_1-2.jpg]]\n\n\n### About PCT\n\nSemantic Web Technologies are basically, part of the foundational technology components that are used for producing Artificial Intelligence systems.   When producing content that uses semantic web technologies such as linked-data (rdf), this provides an array of abilities, however the content being authored is not only the content provided by the individual themselves; in a linked-data document, the terms used are provided meaning via ontologies; such as a document discussing flora or fauna, or statistics or law or a particular circumstance; all of these sorts of written works (as an example) relies both upon the writings of the author and in-turn external resources, that are generally intended to be considered from a perspective of the present-tense; as relates, to when that document was authored. \n\nYet the way HTTP / WWW works currently, it is difficult to maintain the Temporal Semantics or semantic resolution / comprehension, as a consequence of how various websites update or change their content or at times, change their names and no-longer exist.  in other circumstances, the context of the time - is different to the context of a future time; so a link in a webpage describing something, may in-turn refer to an external source that later changes.\n\nThere are many examples of how these sorts of issues results in an inability to maintain knowledge artifacts via current-day web-sources (http / www).  Whilst Archive.org and other sites like it do exist, they become a centralised archive rather than a part of how the internet is made to work - decentralising the responsibility to support these sorts of services, as a component that is as important as other components - such as DNS...  \n\nHistorically also, there has been an 'open data' movement; however these resources are often not made available in a linked-data format; nor are they reliably available and/or verifiable, alongside an array of other qualities that the open-data movement has not seemingly achieved.  So, in response to these issues, [[PermissiveCommons]] ecosystems concepts have grown overtime to respond to various issues that otherwise poorly impact [[FreedomOfThought]] and other values and semantics, of importance overall."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/SafetyProtocols/","title":"Safety Protocols"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Safety Protocols\nThere is a balance between absolute security and secrecy / privacy vs. social needs, to uphold basic values.  The method considered most feasible to address this difficult balance, is emboided by the concept of creating Safety protocols.\n\nThe Safety Protocols requirement will end-up being defined in-full to be interoperable terms with by [[TheWebizenCharter]]. \n\nThe Effect of developing 'safety protocols' is instrumental to providing a means to develop a decentralised social-web framework that supports values based networking between agents (people) in a way that supports the recgonition and use of declared values, to provide support for agents to provide the necessary social protections needed, to be able to create safe decentralised online environments.   \n\nTo the greatest capacity available; the intention is to make as many of the safety protocols as possible, optional.  However, the idea is that there will be notifications about whether or not another agent is running a particular type of safety protocol; as to alert others to their status or ideology, and thereby provide an ability for others they are communicating with, to decide how and/or if they want to communicate with that agent, by being able to take into account whether and/or what safety protcols they're operating.   \n\nSafety protocols may relate to providing insights as to whether or not an agent is who they claim themselves to be; or whether they've got particalar protocols taht are operated in-order to protect themselves and others from materials that are blatently criminal and/or relating to abuses of the human rights of others.  \n\nSafety protocols can be empoyed at different levels; some will be designed to operate at the systems level, others will be designed to operate in connection to the functionality of an app.\n\nSafety protocols will employ [[ValuesCredentialsDev]] and [[PermissiveCommonsTech]], alongside other tooling as required to make an environment that is both able to be made highly secure, and simultaniously also - support safety both for the user and others they interact with, based upon the values they decide to be important for themselves, as individuals / groups.   \n\n## Defining the Webizen Rules - Safety Protocols\n\n  \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/74eqMcmtfWK2Sg4ifOXrf6wLmVOrkz27kUNmjxFq-WNDML6dmx8Z7I9Y225QuCaFl6POX-yDiS-w_4yY19ihp9-PmZWoS0q21TJ7ay1R-4dZp3TGDDaEEpCjDpq5FcIWY3h7JKzDQ8pxuyAwlNSJWcoswCV0D8e11QHIMYa1ibMtfkjkhVuW4G06UVtU)\n\nWhen defining Webizen - I want to consider: The Code of Chivalry - Forming an AI Lore of Chivalry \n\nThe Three Laws of Robotics;\n\nWas first published in 1942 by Isaac Asimov , the concept therefore pre-dates the 1945 post war article by Vannaver Bush on ‘As We May Think’.\n\nFirst Law: \n\nA robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n\nSecond Law: \n\nA robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n\nThird Law: \n\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\n### What other Rules need to be defined?  \nConsiderations include;\n\n1.  It has an owner: it serves its owner(s).\n\n1.  They probably need to be defined in a way that supports the ability for a family to have many different webizen running on the same ‘webizen box’; but if there’s a change (family separation, or child becomes an adult) their ‘webizen’ can be migrated.\n    \n2.  If the owner is a child or is otherwise similarly incapable of ‘personhood’, then it shall be subject to the rules defined by that persons guardian & the ‘webizen rules’.\n\n3.  Cannot Fabricate ‘evidence’, that there must be an ability to audit the logical basis of bot facts\n    \n4.  Defining the rules of ‘Battle Bots’; what is allowed in the civilian domain and what is not allowed?  \n    \n5.  How are rules defined to ensure the people, webizen serve are protected from acts of violence, harms, threats, etc.. \n\n### Webizen Ethics (cont).\n\nThere are also significant ideological considerations that do need to be made; about the difference between designing a ‘thing’ that is a tool; and that the responsibility over how it is designed to operate by its owner, is really up to that person - which is in-turn, a morality related method; that seeks to support ‘personal responsibility’ rather than ‘big brother’ or ‘system defined rules’ of conduct.  This methodology; is in-turn, a bit like providing other types of tools, whether it be desktop computers or applications that work on them, like spreadsheet programs; or physical artefacts, like cars or hammers; all of which, can be used for harmful / wrongful purposes; But that there’s either no controls, or limited controls placed upon the sale of these ‘products’. \n\nIn effect a design method; to support the notion, that “The primary person responsible for ones behaviour is themselves…”...   Therein - design standards would in-turn seek to ensure that the natural persons who owns their ‘webizen’ (environment); is supported, in seeking to ensure that they are indeed, responsible for the actions of their webizen.  This would include an array of design qualities & requirements; to ensure this form of ideology is indeed supported; whilst also offering a capacity for innovators to innovate.\n\nBut the consequence, much like cars or hammers - is that people might seek to use them as a weapon; as such, there are various considerations to be made about how best to address this problem, perhaps not so much in relation to the ‘webizen’ tooling itself; but moreover, how it is designed to be supported by broader ecosystems - including but not limited to, law & legal processes.\n\nYet - these considerations are not intended to entirely absolve responsibility for ensuring good design.  Part of the ‘webizen.org’ initiative, is to figure out how to form a multi-stakeholder approach to forming ‘open standards’ that support and are in-turn supported by participants who get involved.\n\nThere are various methods to seek to provide hygiene and ensure that ‘webizen systems’ are safe and indeed also; very secure (technically).  \n\nIt is considered that a ‘webizen’ be a far more complicated form of ‘identity apparatus’ or tooling; which is very different to the present-day mainstream ‘beliefs’ about the benefits for mankind by issuing them ‘wallets’ powered by ‘web3’ with keys / credentials, that can be reissued in the case the wallet is lost.  \n\nThis isn’t just about ‘wallets’, its moreover about human agency - and the need to produce a solution, despite the consequences of decisions made by others to not provide infrastructure online to support human agency (ie: my old ‘knowledge banking’ works); by refactoring the designs, to better consider / take into account; the circumstances where the primary goals relate to ‘property’ (inclusive to AI / Information Infrastructure) & contract law.  \n\nThe outcome of producing Webizen, should result in significant ‘safety / dignity’ improvements for the people who are able to buy one, and have it help them with their life as influenced via technology.  Part of how this will be achieved is via ‘safety protocols’ (per below, but think - star-trek, holodeck - which has safety protocols); therein, some of what needs to be done, is a bunch of work on various forms of values frameworks that need to be produced as ontologies, so that owners can decide which ‘optional’ ones they want to employ’ whilst, the product may not function if the mandatory ones are not ‘turned on’ or in some way otherwise corrupted (aka safety protocols).\n\n\n#### Necessary Protections - [[SafetyProtocols]]\n\nIn Star-Trek Voyager - the ‘holodeck’ systems, have ‘safety protocols’ to protect people; so should webizen. Designing these systems is important, so that the way those safety outcomes are achieved; are designed, rather than forced - in ways that are likely to result in other sorts of consequences. \n\nWhilst I'm not sure what they will be yet, there is a need to ensure these boxes cannot be used in a federated manner to engender an attack..  \n\nThe types of attacks will need to be defined (mis-use cases; and in-turn, a framework to attend to these threats developed and addressed; in a manner that does not breach ‘first principles’ which are in-turn also to be defined, but are essentially about the protection and support of human rights.  \n\nThese ‘codes’ should be produced as part of the webizen.org works broadly; leveraging, broad-ranging discussions about ‘ai ethics’ through a different lens; a lens, where its now able to be focused upon a concept where, people, may in-future, own their own robots; and as a new and innovative form of ‘artificial species’ or ‘artificial agent’, form ‘common-sense’ approaches to what sorts of things should be discouraged, what sorts of governance principles should apply - and fundamentally; when a person gets a ‘webizen’, perhaps they sign an oath; or, that they’ll need to install their own software/firmware, as a consequence of deciding not to; but, part of the necessary protections are also, that people should be able to transfer their webizen environment (the data / software environment) and operate it on compatible systems; as is a form of protection.\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n\n\n`#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/Sense/","title":"Sense Project"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Sense Project\n\nThe Sense project is a [[PermissiveCommons]] related project, that's focused on building a comprehensive [[HumanCentricAI]] Language system.\n\n## Sense\n\nSense seeks to be a construct that provides an understanding of the English vocabulary. It should employ a range of structured language datasets and services, particularly employing those that have been produced using RDF.  It should also consume various stem language datasets, both written, oral and pictorial. The model should be able to generate derivative vocabulary models.\n\nWhilst the primary language focus is presently English, the addition of geospatial and temporal provenance information of information that is known about the history of words, phrases and their meanings will require the model to be trained against an array of other language datasets.  \n\nThe model should be able to be distributed online using a DLT protocol, such as some form of DHT based method - that may well include the use of GIT or guneco.  it is important that the system is designed to preserve privacy.  how people communicate either in written, typed or spoken form in private circumstances is a private matter; and any social circumstances must employ clearly defined terms.\n\nThe system should also be adaptive and generative, perhaps employing a network of models that interoperable perform personal generative processing with both clear declarative and procedural semantics; in addition to clearly labelled inferences.\n\nThe model should be able to be trained to be able to be used in a variety of contexts, including but not limited to:\n\n    * Dictionary and Spellcheck\n    * Ontology Production\n    * Ontology Reasoning\n    * Search\n    * Database Queries\n    * Database Structures\n    * Content Metadata Generation\n    * Ai Assistants\n    * API Generation\n\nThe docs are located at [Sense](http://sense-docs.webizen.au/)  and presently only provide basic introductory information that relates to the sense project.

The dev-docs for webizen also incorporate some information about a related dependency called Permissive Commons.   Whilst doing the R&D to implement these systems, the complexities involved in seeking to properly define the AI Enabled Human Centric; Vocabulary systems, and related systems requirements; led me to starting a new documentation site to better structure thoughts, requirements, considerations and all such related notes, facets, deliberations, components, etc.. \n\nBasically; its a fairly difficult thing to do well, and it appears that the implications of attempting to do so brings about an array of highly sophistocated challenges. So, i thought it best to write more about it, as i go about doing the work to implement something functional in working software, etc.\n\nI just came-up with the name sense, i thought it was a good name for it.  The Ai Agents that are plugged into my systems are constantly telling me that its about a model; when i don't really see it that way, nor do i think that the system for better supporting the employment of language with AI agents - is the same sort of thing like ChatGPT or other systems that are called 'language models', when they appear more to be a form of 'knowledge model'; and often, its not very good with understanding the language it professes to be developed to do.\n\nIn anycase;\n\nThe purpose of this project is to use advanced, modern techniques to develop a language model that will be firstly focused upon defining to the best of our ability, the english language, in an extensible way; that can then be developed further by others to better support other languages.  Languages are fundamentally social things, its a foundational part of how we organise our means to communicate, and is a foundational pillar for how we organise anything socially and in-turn also, an integrally useful artiface associated to and/or weith consciousness, as is able to be processed by observers. \n\nThe video by Json Silva about Ontological Design, may usefully simplify the concept.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nNow therefore; the objective purpose is to define a system that'll be implemented as (working software); that will in-turn be integrally employed to construct other webizen related systems.

The is consideredto be a critical requirements to support the [[WorkProject]] and in-turn address [[SocialAttackVectors]] and support [[SafetyProtocols]].\n\n## Background Notes\n\nThe values project is premised upon a desire to ensure people are furnished an opportunity to express terms in relation to online contracts.  This in-turn stimulates the development of a symmetrical agreement framework, rather than asymmetrical, as is the case today - as a consequence of the designs & priorities, illustrated by others at large.\n\nThere is presently no known solution to express ‘values’. There is also no good solution for humans to declare preferences with respect to the collection of information or the storage of profiling related information - such as cookies.  Whereas a relatively simple solution to address the ‘pop-ups’ that appear in websites asking for ‘cookie permissions’ would remove the need for these sorts of things, for users; The ‘values’ frameworks, is intended to provide a capacity for persons to define a set of terms that are expected to be honored; and in-turn, as a consequence of contract law - as is used by electronic services to seek rights, that any breach of contract may result in consequences / penalties / enforceable obligations.   \n\nWhilst the basic concept may be employed for purposes not intended (exploits, in-effect - as is personally felt to be the case with the broader ‘platform’ this looks to be deployed with); the purpose of this project at the present-time, is to focus on declarative instruments that are well-known and/or relating to jurisdictional laws.  In particular, the first examples will seek to deploy solutions for SDGs, Human Rights instruments and other ethics related statements of significance for international use.\n\n# Goals\n\n## Technical Goals\n\n1.  To produce a solution that provides a means for a branded images to be used to denote a corresponding values statement; in a manner that,\n    \n\ta.  supports both inspection of the terms via language (ie: english); and also,\n    \n\tb.  Machine Readable Semantics (RDF).\n    \n2.  To furnish the ability for electronic systems to be able to accept these instruments as part of the electronic contracting process; whereby,\n    \n\ta.  The  ‘values’ credentials in relation to their online contracting (“identity”) systems.\n    \n\tb.  That these terms are provided the same legal capacity as the use of other ‘identity’ related instruments used in relation to electronic contracts; and to,\n    \n\tc.  Enable signed documents that are able to be retained in a manner that is ‘tamper evident’ and consistent with the exact copy executed by the parties involved.  \n\n3.  To enable end-users to find, collect & use commonly known ‘values statements’; as a way to empower users to usefully engage with others upon a basis of mutually defined & articulated values (rights & rules) that are important to them online.\n    \n4.  The ability to manage the relationships they’ve made online with other legal entities. \n    \n5.  The ability to distribute these assets in a permissively controlled manner via DLT URIs in addition to HTTP(s) uris. \n\n\n## Social Goals\n\n6.  To illustrate & address the issues that act to hinder the useful purpose of ‘digital identity’ to serve & support the rights of persons; rather than being employed to empower rulers above & beyond rights; by forming the infrastructure needed to address how we fix it. \n    \n7.  To provide a capacity to engage in online projects with others via contract law principles on a basis of ‘shared values’; or in-effect, \n    \n\ta.  Legal tools to better manage relationships with others via electronic contracts. \n    \n\tb.  To Support rights & address issues that seek to dismantle our foundational rights.\n    \n\tc.  To improve the basis upon which we are empowered to work together in peace.\n    \n\td.  To support the ability for people to do good work for humanity - in areas, where there may be ‘dual use’ (or similar) implications, that are not sought to be endorsed or furnished meaningful assistance in any way common to intended purposes.\n    \n\n# Specifications - issues\n\nIn writing these ‘specifications’, there’s a few known issues; such as,\n\n-   The nomenclature;  Terms such as ‘wallet’ as to define a person by their ‘wallet’ is not considered desirable.  \n    \nThinking ATM; it's more like a persons robot app - R2-D2 or a persons ‘digital twin’ control interface & means to create, store & manage evidence.\n\n-   The differences between what is easily achieved vs. what is hoped to be achieved.  Addressing this issue features implications relating to time / resources / talent.\n    \n-   The hope / desire is to define the ‘minimum viable solution’ to then engage in further development, which is hoped to be exponential in nature overtime.\n    \n-   The broader intended ecosystem - is different to the ‘ssi’ ecosystem model; although, it is also desirable to ensure that any dominant ‘platform solutions’ be made compatible. \n    \n\n# Specifications Goals\n\nThe specification goals seek to outline what it is that the design is attempting to triage.  \n\nThere’s a few components to it.\n\n1.  The way in which the ‘Sem Web Ontologies’ are handled generally.\n\ta. [[UnderstandingOntologies]] provides general 'non-technical' information.  \n      \n2.  Ideally, the moral owners of the ‘[[ValuesCredentials]]’ would be stewards of those instruments, versions of them, etc.  \n    \n3.  Presently HTTP Uris are used for ontologies - DLT/DHT ontologies are useful; as such, the objective is to implement PermissiveCommons. \n    \n4.  VerifiableClaims & Credentials  (including the above noted 'values credentials') are also able to be provided by providers / group entities.\n    \n3. There are presently ‘wallets’ that are defined in a particular way, which is in-turn part of a broader ecosystem that is developing.  \n    \n\ta.  I don’t like the term ‘wallet’.  \n    \n\tb. I am also not confident that the specifications of these ‘wallets’ will be ‘fit for purpose’, as such changes might need to be made. \n    \n\tc. There is a desire to store an array of digital artifacts via a ‘personal cloud’ (protected by law) solution; that will end-up having alot of ‘important (s/w files) documents’ in it.  This isn’t simply a ‘wallet’ & its not quite to the extent to which (in future) the hope is to end-up producing a capacity that might be termed an inforg.\n\n4.  The solution will require packages that are built for online platforms like wordpress.\n    \n5.  A major part of the intended purpose of these works, is to end-up with a solution that can be used for collaboratively undertaking online projects with others.  This ‘projects’ element, will in-turn require additional functionality.\n    \n6.  There is a requirement also to support ‘verifiable claims’, which may be different to what are now known as ‘verifiable credentials’.  These requirements would include the ability to define characteristics of persons required to engage in projects.\n    \n8.  The ‘values’ credentials are intended to support ‘logic’ processes that will progressively improve support for compliance tracking & relationships between credentials.\n    \n9.  A modeling requirement will be needed, in time, to support arbitration considerations where values stipulated in one of the values' credentials, has considerations that may conflict with others; as evaluated on a situation-specific basis. \n    \n10.  Seniors (in particular) have problems retaining their password / username details for websites, something that is similar to what is known as a ‘password manager’ is required. There is also ‘hearsay’ that suggests government workers in agencies relating to national security & defense, may not be properly (securely) storing their access credential information (ie: putting the information into a document that’s stored on their desktop).\n    \n11.  Designs need to consider how solutions will scale to support the needs of persons whose decisions are able to be made as a consequence of consent by a guardian.  A way to address these sorts of issues was historically attempted through the lens of a ‘pets app’. \n    \n12.  Another use-case of importance (i think) is the ability to support ‘annotations’ on content.\n    \n\n# Specifications Resources & Considerations\n\n I am advised that the US company SpruceID ( [https://github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid) ) has been doing good work. I note in particular, their libraries for a ‘did kit’ and also a ‘did wallet’ solution.  It does not appear that the ‘did’ / ‘ssi’ solution presently supports functionality otherwise produced (earlier) for the education market; whereby notes include,\n\n-   [https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html](https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html)\n    \n-   [https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/](https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/) \n\nWhereby the problem with ‘open badges’ is that they’re very much designed for education / academia; rather than an ability for people to have a similar sort of thing, relating to values.\n\nA related, desirable requirement; is to produce the tooling required to support the means for people to articulate licenses & other terms in relation to work activities online (inc. accrued rights); alongside, a means to support the ability for web-sites, to support membership and/or privacy related ‘credentials’; which would have the effect of addressing two linked issues,\n\n1.  The GDPR pop-up issue could be addressed for users of this ‘Digital Vault’’.\n    \n2.  The ‘membership’ and/or related instruments (could be group instruments / affiliations, etc.) could better support the means to address ‘micro-payments’ use-cases for content that is not otherwise publicly available. \n    \n\nMore sophisticated considerations; relating to ‘cyber security’ / sensitive projects, confidence, etc.\n\n‘[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)\n\nThere are circumstances where people will be bound to obligations (ie: employment or professional obligations) that preclude them from being able to engage on a basis that may otherwise be afforded to them;  support for considerations are important.\n\nThere is also; a significant desire for support for instruments; that may be private and/or sensitive in nature, such as clearances, vetting, police / working with children checks, etc. \n\nThis may also include a requirement to have credentials should there be problems with these sorts of ‘checks’, as may be taken into account by others when seeking to engage in fair-dealings.\n\nAlso - there should be means to address personal & humanitarian related issues; relating to mental health / illness & treatment related characteristics that should seek to better support people who are acting honestly & responsibly, rather than those who deceptively seek gainful benefits otherwise - this is in-turn, not intended to act punitively; rather, to support security.\n\nFinally; the intended ‘cyber security schema’, featured various constituent components to the overarching authentication fabric, which was in-turn an enabler for activity related factors. The effect was, to bring about an ecosystem solution - that is more appropriate for real-world security capabilities - subject to - deployment methodologies, law & operational capabilities. \n\nSome of these more complex considerations are desirable, but perhaps treated differently. \n\nNOTE:  In related work, there are various projects that will be seeking to employ these tools; whilst also, making them available for broader use.   The projects i’m particularly focused on presently are as follows;\n\n1.  An International Peace Infrastructure Project\n    \n2.  A Cyber capabilities project (domestic)\n    \n3.  A ‘community’ app & related ecosystem (for FNQ). \n\n\nWhilst the ‘initial requirements’ for each of these projects do have differences; there are also core requirements that are sought to be employed for all of them; and, as a consequence of ‘human centric designs’, it is expected that at least some people who seek to use this ‘identity solution’ will be involved in all of these projects, alongside many more.  \n\nThe expectation is that there will be an array of authentication & cyber-security technologies used to create a form of ‘informatics fabric’ that seeks to produce a hardened trustworthy environment;  this is not similar to the design of ‘SSI’ & related commercial solutions; yet, the design of the underlying technologies later used for SSI relates to the history of these tools.\n\n## Addressing the ‘social factors’;\n\nThe concept of addressing the social factors has been an on-going ‘discussion’, with little progress; and much of the progress that has been made, done in ways that weren’t ‘all good’.\n\nThere is a vital requirement to set-up a capacity for people to expressly state terms they seek to be employed in the online contracts they enter into online; and in-turn, furnish an opportunity for a market-segment of online services that support this sort of social-ideology, to grow and i believe - flourish.  There are many, many ‘projects’, or jobs / things about peace, human rights - good stuff, areas of work - that needs to be done; but it can’t reasonably be done in a manner that is built upon a propagated belief that the idea of ‘web slavery’ or ‘digital slavery’ or any form of slavery / abuse of human rights & other related values - should be considered fair or reasonable or ok in any way whatsoever - when its clearly not. \n\nThere is a change in modality that is able to be achieved - as is otherwise required - for the ‘more sophisticated use-cases’ alongside the needs of people, who seek a life - of respect, dignity & fairness unto ‘rule of law’, including a capacity to engage with civic (ie: elections) & civics (ie: peace infrastructure, or advocating for means to address social problems / issues) activities…\n\nSome of these requirements do in-turn require a means to have a safe space to store records of importance.   This is presently not very well provided for by existing solutions that now thereby define the nature of the ‘identities’ of the persons who’ve been involved & the values of their groups.  Whilst it is hoped that these sorts of exhibits will be positively influenced through the production of technology - that led to the way things are done today - to be made, to function as intended - it is also expected, that some people will always prefer alternatives for various reasons; in this way, its not unlike the circumstance of ‘freedom of religion’, whereby the concept of choice - is intended to be empowering, and not a device to force others to comply, in circumstances where the implications are knowingly unlawful & without lawful remedy by design. \n\n## The use of PNG or SVG Containers\n\nThe concept is to use PNG, SVG or other suitably defined image formats as a form of container format for VerifiableClaims & Credentials is a fairly old concept, that was instrumental to the OpenBadges designs.  The 'image' format (particularly SVG) may be interactive / dynamic or may be static.  The Container would then also include the semantic ontology formatted to support presentation of what that asset communicates both in a human readable form and in a format that can be consumed by software agents (rdf).  \n\nIn the future there may be a better definition for a file-container method that becomes standardized as something other than an SVG; nonetheless, its thought - SVGs will do for now. \n\n## Temporal support\n\nWhilst it is desirable to start with the ‘values credentials’ that have static meanings or are represented in a manner that defines the version (noting - new version of laws emerge all the time, perhaps a qualification URI should check for any new versions as to support validity); as does, the circumstances in which the credential was used.  As such, there are a variety of time-stamps that are important to employ, as to ensure historical records remain accurate.\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/WorkProject/","title":"The Work Project"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# The Work Project\n\nThe 'Work Project' has a multitude of constituencies, and is basically motivated by a desire to prioritise [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] in relation to [[KnowledgeWork]]. \n\n### Index\n\n- [[ContributionClassifications]]\n\t- [[Resources]]\n\t\t- [[EquipmentAndSupplies]]\n\t\t- [[LabourWork]]\n\t- [[KnowledgeWork]]\n\t\t- [[IntellectualProperty]]\n\t\t- [[LicensingFrameworks]]\n- [[WorkValuationMethods]]\n- [[Currencies]]\n\t- [[ESG]]\n\t\t- [[EnergyCalcs]]\n\t\t- [[BiosphereCalcs]]\n\t\t- [[SocioshereCalcs]]\n- [[ValueAccountingInitiatives]]\n\nSome very early stage front-end works have been started and are available in this repo on [github](https://github.com/WebCivics/CooperativeProjects).  Yet, there is a long-history of related works and links that i'll add to the Work Project folder at some stage (when i get to it)...\n\n![[cooperativeProjects.jpg]]\n\nThe Work project is perhaps one of the most essential elements to the broader Peace Infrastructure Project, including but not limited to; the enabling works described as being constituencies of WebCivics alongside that of Webizen are intended to produce an environment that supports the means to provide economic models that better support the needs of those who are primarily engaged in fields of [[KnowledgeWork]] in particular; yet, the methodologies have an array of other applications more broadly.\n\nThese other usecases will seek to consider producing a means to provide tools for people whose lives would be benefited if they were more easily able to manage their ability to engage with a multitude of employers and those whose type of work involves multiple clients  providing payments for their services; alongside other use-cases more broadly.  \n\nHowever, the fundamental requirement of the work prject, is to support both; the works relating to the development of WebCivics, which will continue to develop works that are more focused on [[WebScience]] activities; alongside, Webizen and the WebizenAlliance (and/or WebCivics Alliance) requirements. The means to do anything else hinges upon the ability to produce a platform that is designed to be made able to support how any other forms of work are able to be done, using it.  As such; the critical technical requirements are now being made part of the Human Centric Web project. It is hoped that better solutions will emerge through the growth of participants doing useful works (or works that become useful).\n\n## Background Notes\n\nThe Work Project is something that various attempts have been made to produce since 2000. \n\nIn 2019 a study was undertaken listing all of the [[ValueAccountingInitiatives]] that existed at that time, as an effort was being made to raise capital to put some pieces together; and then, 2000 rolled around and alot of things changed for a lot of people. \n\nFundamentally, when seeking to apply these considerations towards the intended focus of seeking to ensure [[BestEfforts]] are being made towards [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] whilst seeking to improve how [[ValuesCredentials]] are materially supported; in areas relating to the use of resources for the production of works that have an intended purpose of being good for humanity (ie: stuff, that's not really purely 'commercial' in form); but that it is entirely reasonable (indeed important) that persons are treated equitably, particularly those engaged in activities that are focused upon achiving positive outcomes linked to [[ValuesCredentials]] related considerations.  Certainly, the idea that such forms of work should be exploited and punitively discouraged; whilst actively promoting and endorsing via transactional activity those who gainfully do the opposite, certainly brings with it an array of implications.\n\n*ideologies that are not compatible with [[WebCivicsCharter]] or related instruments...*\n\nThe applied consideration; Is to support a framework where all forms of [[ProjectFinancing]] are treated equally.  That is, that if unpaid or funded work is undertaken by someone and the useful derivatives of that contribution are useful; then, they're treated in the same way as any other investor - subject to an array of particular terms, to better contextualise the nature of the circumstance, etc.  This seeks to engender rules that basically act to support 'good faith relations' in a manner that attends to the intended meaning fo the statements outlined by the [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments,  structurally.\n\nThereafter, there is an array of [[ContributionClassifications]] that are importantly defined which then have implications on the [[WorkValuationMethods]] and in-turn also, the licensing frameworks.  \n\nThere are an array of [[SocialAttackVectors]] that will directly target these constituencies of the ecosystem.  It is important that there are both clear rules and systems in place to address disputes.  The [[LicensingFrameworks]] will be particularly attentive to circumstances in which works relate to the fundemental rights of Human Beings (ie: Core [[ValuesCredentials]] ); and will distinguish between natural persons (human beings), organisations with reduced means vs. users who are enterprise, large corporations, Government and other similar sorts of entities whose nature is different and that there is a capacity to form licensing frameworks for those types of users in a manner that distinguishes their obligations differently to those of others. \n\nThis type of mechanism is intended to provide the means to support [[KnowledgeWork]] compensation for the development and creation of tooling that is required to support the foundational requirements of tooling relating to the Peace Infrastructure Project in a manner that seeks compensatory revenues (income) from organisations; whom, for example, may be defined as having a cash flow of above $3m AUD Per Annum or by way of structural identity frameworks (ie: in circumstances where analysis is not feasible); as may be determined; whilst,\n\n*Providing the derivative tooling free of charge to all other users.*  \n\nIn other circumstances; where the work-derivative is some sort of 'optional' `#thing` then the cost may be collected from all users at some rate defined by the projects leaders; but that, the overall compensatory amount is sought to be built upon a fixed return for the total effort calc (ie: [[ProjectFinancing]] ); for whatever that body of work is defined as being.  In some cases, work will continue to provide new versions and/or additional maintainence and support for whatever that thing is; which in-turn, ends-up being attributed to the economic frameworks associated with that thing.\n\nWhilst conceptually supported; yet not at all the focus at present, if someone invents something that is entirely optional, as in - its a market based product that might be distinct, yet, a persons life (ie: [[ValuesCredentials]] ) are not going to be disaffected by not having it; then, whoever sells it is entirely entitled to seek to charge whatever they want; and if people want to pay for it, that's really upto them.  as they say 'its a free market'; yet, these sorts of considerations do not apply to works that are critical for Peace Infrastructure Project related purposes.  \n\n**Donations**: if people want to make donations or gift to persons above and beyond the project related economic protocols; that's ok, but also not sought to be required.\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/AboutWebCivics/","title":"About Web Civics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# About Web Civics\n\n### Background\n\nWeb Civics was established in 2014 for the purpose of seeking to improve support for cooperative and collaborative 'Web' 'Civics' works by members of our human family across the world; to produce outcomes via technology related works, for the betterment of humanity.  Overtime the founder of Web Civics and an array of others who've been involved since that time, have participated in the development of projects relating to technologies, some of which have become instrumentally important worldwide.  The specific concept of Human Centric AI first started some years ago.  Sometime later, the Facebook Group [Human Centric AI](https://www.facebook.com/groups/humancentric.ai.tech) was set-up although not enough has been done with it since. \n\nThe term 'Human Centric AI' has proliferated over recent years, and is often used in connection to various different sorts of considerations and fields of interest; and in-turn also, sought to be applied to different types of systems that present different types of characteristics. As the consequences of AI is becoming far more apparent, it appeared to me that it would be good to have some sort of community engagement structure that could help foster the growth of Human Centric AI considerations - for the betterment of humanity.\n\nThe Purpose of Web Civics is about the production of Technology for the Public Good.  The practice method includes an array of [[WebScience]] related considerations, although not exclusively.  The Intended outcome of Web Civics, has been to produce an international framework of For Purpose Web Civics 'Alliance' members; to support the production of technology for the public good.  The ultimate goal, is to produce outcomes that meaningfully support the development of Peace Infrastructure. To achieve this, technology must be defined and implemented in-iorder to give effect to works for [[EndingDigitalSlavery]], supporting [[FreedomOfThought]], empowering [[FairWorkProtocols]] and spearheading the development of various other activities that have purposefully positive goals.  \n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/IntellectualPropertyAgreement/","title":"WebCivics IP Agreement"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# WebCivics IP Agreement\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nIntellectual property refers to the legal rights that protect the creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce.

Trade secrets: Trade secrets protect confidential business information, such as recipes, formulas, and customer lists.\n\nIntellectual property law is designed to balance the interests of creators and the public by granting certain exclusive rights to creators, while also allowing for the use and dissemination of ideas and information for the benefit of society.\n\n## Web Civics Agreement.\n\nThe Copyright and Intellectual Property Agreement for Human Centric AI projects undertaken via this Web Civics community environment, is sought to be considered on a project-by-project basis; and may be subject to one of many different types of Agreements.  \n\nIn future; it is an objective that does in-turn support the [[WebCivicsCharter]] to seek to form apparatus that may act to better support [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] whilst simultaniously seeking to ensure that persons are both properly renumerated for useful [[KnowledgeWork]] in a defined and limited manner; as such, to ensure that works are neither subject to royalties or other financial dues in perpetuity; notwithstanding, the fair and necessary right for persons to be paid fairly for useful works that are the product of their time, choices & use of resources, whether it be their own or those of others who may have supported them to do good work.\n\nAs these systems do not exist, a compromise must be made.  The manner through which this is thought best applied at this stage, is to require persons involved in forming particular projects; to cooperatively define which of the following terms should be applied upon their group works.   These methodologies are sought to be updated and improved upon overtime.\n\nIt is considered that there are a few key areas of importance to be addressed as of now.\n\n1. Other Peoples Intellectual Property and/or Intellectual Property Rights.\n2. Copyright terms for works performed and/or contributed to these efforts.\n3. Software Licensing Terms for works produced and/or contributors in connection with these efforts.\n\n## 3rd Party Works.\n\nIntellectual Property that is contributed for use by the community should be authorised by the copyright / moral owner of those works.  There is a duty to notify where this is not the case, and moreover it is preferred that any such activity is not done at all...  \n\nWorks produced by others should be clearly identified; both in terms of the known author, and/or any known or unknown aspects related to the provonance of the works and/or artifacts.\n\n# Copyright\n\nThe Copyright Agreement for Human Centric AI projects undertaken via this Web Civics community environment, may be subject to one of many different types of Copyright Agreements.  The broader suggestion is that works develop to better support a dual-licensing methodology; this may in-turn act to better support the [[ValuesCredentials]] related considerations by being able to better address the needs of different cohorts that exist throughout our societies, without unnecessarily failing to consider the needs of people.\n\nThe three primary instruments that are intended to be employed at this stage; \n\n- [[CC_BY-NC-4.0-License]] - Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International\n- [[CC_BY-SA-4.0-License]] - Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International \n- [[CC_CC0-1.0-Universal]] - Public Domain Dedication No Attribution Required.\n\nFor projects where the objective is considered to be critical to [[ValuesCredentials]] related issues and the implications are such that it doesn't matter how something good happens to improve a situation, its just important that it happens - the Public Domain license, basically means the burden for having done what was required to make it and any consequential issues that may arise, is taken on by the creators; and the derivative works are made free.\n\nThe ShareAlike license is similar, yet the difference is that they must provide attribution; which may in-turn be something that they're able to remove if they elect to engage in-order to obtain a different license.  This is commonly used with photos and other media that may be distributed with this type of license, but the media contains a watermark or identifier.\n\nThe Attribution Non-Commercial is similar to the Attribution ShareAlike, but, the work is not licensed for the purpose of employing it for commercial purposes; but its free to use otherwise, so long as the consumer of it abides by the attribution terms of the license.\n\nA list of other well-known licenses (particularly with respect to software) is made available via the [Open Source Initiative Here](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/OurValues/","title":"Our Values"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Our Values\n\nWeb Civics activities seek to develop a somewhat unique [[CommunityOfPractice]] that works within a particular area, in a manner that is guided by the values set-out by [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments as have been provided via links in said note to the original articles. \n\nFurthermore, we make the continual undertaking to always make [[BestEfforts]], and to seek to ensure the tools that we seek to produce alone or with others are [[FitForPurpose]].\n\nWe seek to improve our capacity to deliver better tooling to support [[FairWorkProtocols]] and in-turn act to [[EndingDigitalSlavery]], whilst forming improved means to support people who work to produce better outcomes, instruments and tooling to support [[SafetyProtocols]], etc."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/","title":"Social Attack Vectors"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Social Attack Vectors\n\nThe purpose of the folder on Social Attack Vectors, is to provide definition and illustration of various sorts of behaviours that are interactively undertaken in a manner that can be 'sensed' or inferenced by [[HumanCentricAI]] technology; and that therefore, are amongst the issues that need to be responded to on a [[BestEfforts]] basis, to form a [[FitForPurpose]] solution that is better able to address these sorts of issues than may otherwise be the case. \n\nThe considerations include [[CyberAttackVectors]] as a consequence of their being the product of the efforts or 'semantics' of human beings; as such, the software agents that may be involved in a Cyber Atttack Vector are not considered to exist to serve itself. \n\nEach of these sorts of problems need to be considered and solutions that are not dependant upon whether or not public sector workers act appropriately (ie: support criminal prosecutions or probity / hygiene within public sector institutions).  Persons should not be required to continue to be in a relationship of dependance with an abuser and/or someone who is shown to be engaging in hostile acts for gainful purposes.  Furthermore, circumstances relating to support for [[GuardianshipRelations]] and related [[GuardianshipSemantics]] deliberations; requires means to support a carer in the event that the person whom they are caring for, becomes involved in a problem that may jepordise both the person requiring care and in-turn also, the carer.  This is not to be considered as any form of approval for abuse within any such guardian/dependent relationship; rather, it is to consider that the appropriation of social attack vectors are most-often executed upon persons that the attacker considers to be vulnerable and that the potential consequences for being identified as having engaged in wrongdoing is low to negligable. \n\nNOTE:  Personally, i am mindful of circumstances where persons paid by public funds have engaged in wrong-ful behaviour with serious implications that can never be properly addressed; and that, i have this memory of those who engaged in these sorts of activities, spilling fluids - seeking forgiveness and a continued focus upon their wellbeing - whilst organisationally it was entirely evident that they were set-up to perform [[StrategicHarms]] in a manner that was designed to ensure there was no evidence.  [[ProtectingDependants]] and other vulnerable people - lawfully, requires means for persons, irraspective of how negatively impacted they are; they may be seriously injured mentally and physically, even thereafter also - made homeless - as the desire of organised behaviours (ie: [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]] ) seeks to invalidate their lives; yet, these systems - are expressly designed to ensure any such person, can walk into a court of law and through the use of their [[HumanCentricAI]] systems - tell the truth and seek help.  The consideration is not about the person who gainfully harmed others seeking to make payment via [[TheSecret]] in their pity puddle of their own making; rather, it is to ensure that the [[TheValuesProject]] delivers a means, that furnishes the opportunity for a judge to make considerations about what it is they observe in relation to evidence provided about a matter (comprehensively); and thereby, depend upon their character and proper use of their most important role in our systems of society, governance and consequentially thereafter also - Peace.   This in-turn acts to discourage persons who may otherwise seek to take matters into their own hands, as is a consequence of various forms of war-like behaviour whether declared, well known - or otherwise; which in-turn also, seeks to better support a means to distinguish the circumstances of persons, as is built via the derivative output of [[TheValuesProject]].  The [[WebizenAlliance]] and instrumentally therein also; [[TheWebizenCharter]] is intended to be very clear both by statement and consequential technical apparatus, about rendering support for human right and other related [[ValuesCredentials]].  Whilst not all disputes are sought to become the topic of a case that necessarily requires consideration via a court of law; those who gainfully exist via an ideology that is built upon skills to intentionally and unlawfully harm other people for gainful purposes -  should find the webizen ecosystem, hostile.\n\nPersons who find themselves in a situation that involves a dispute, should be encouraged to work it out between themselves, yet this is not always feasible and in some cases, its simply inappropriate.   In other systems - a 'command and control' method has been employed, which hsa not demonstrated a capacity to support the human rights of persons very well or in many cases, at all.  Conversely, others have sought to produce systems that are entirely confidential and secret.  In both cases, there  are issues that relate to social attack vectors not being appropriately triageable. \n\nIn consideration; the 'balanced' approach, seeks to support 'good faith' relations, not as a disability or vulnerability but rather - as a strength.  Each individual user, is responsible for defining their own values frameworks, which are in-turn provided support via the webizen ecosystems and related [[ValuesCredentials]] related systems; which are in-turn supported via the [[SafetyProtocols]] that support the announcation of linked semantics.\n\n## Summary\n\n**Topics include; but are not limited to,** \nDishonesty, Usury, Exploitation, Abuse, Malfesence, Social Harms, Deceptive & Misleading Behaviours, Wrongs, Financial Crimes, Corproate Crimes, Attacks Online, Fraud, Social Engineering, etc.  \n\nAs the ecosystem is intended to be 'human centric' the implications of attack vectors that involve the use of technology (ie: cyber) has been incorporated.....\n\n*IMHO: At the end of the day, harms caused to [[BiosphereOntologies]] entities, is fundamentally caused by other [[BiosphereOntologies]] entities, regardless of the [[SocioSphereOntologies]] related implications.*  \n\n*There are various forms of Social Attack Vectors, Actions and Activities; that have existed for a very long time, and others that have become a problem in recent decades due to the implications of the use of technology, as does in-turn relate to designs.* \n\nSo far, i have been able to produce some materials that cover the following sub-topics,\n\n- [[AttacksOnline]]\n- [[CriminalActivity]]\n- [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]]\n- [[CommercialExploitation]]\n- [[Dehumanisation]]\n- [[Dishonesty]]\n- [[FakeNews]]\n- [[TemporalAttacks]]\n\n\nThere is an enormous amount of work to be done in relation to this area, and it will take some time.  I also find it to be emotionally exhausting (as noted below); in the meantime, here are some of my thoughts on considerations related to this area of work that is importantly done, to an appropriate level, as to thereafter ensure solutions are illustratively equipped to demonstrate how the ecosystems are intended to work to put a stop to it and/or provide vastly improved means for accessibility to lawful remedy for disaffected persons.  \n\n\n\n#### Introduction: Purpose\n\n\n![[codeofchivalry.jpg]]\n\n\n[[TheValuesProject]] seeks to employ various methods, including [[WebScience]] and other [[SocialFactors]] related considerations to structure methodologies to enable means for people to be better equipped to both benefit from the support of [[SafetyProtocols]] and related considerations; a difficult, yet important documentation requirment is to make note of various types of 'social attack vectors', whether they're intended to be addressed via [[TrustFactory]] related methodologies or more broadly otherwise (ie; web civics, etc.) its still important that they're able to be considered somehow. \n\n> *Personally, i stuggle doing these sorts of tasks and find it very difficult to have a level of comfort about the idea that i've illustrated the problems well enough, or that it is a safe thing to undertake to do; there is both great sadness and an enormous amount of life invested into seeking to be positively responsive towards addressing problems relating to the human rights of others; and in most cases, it can't really be fully discussed publically. Yet what can be done, is that the underlying principals can be illustrated as a means to support design considerations that denote a level of responsibility that has been so clearly absent from the work done by others.  It is all well and good to solely care about 'yourself' selfishly, and not address the means to address problems - but this is neither appropriate nor responsible, nor consistant with the actual fundamental relationship between leadership and the responsibilities that are inextricably linked to the appropriate use of that term as to strive towards living in a manner that is consistant with, what may be considered a fundamental belief in the existance of universal moral values; as is something that has been referred to for consideration by [Professor Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky)... *\n> \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJ2vr2YnSGA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n>*As i have noted elsewhere, on the 3rd of April 2018 in response to corraspondance with Professor Chomsky, as i worked to pursue the development of the ontology related works required to support [[FreedomOfThought]] and related requirements.  The percieved problem was that whilst many of the [W3C CG](W3.org/community/) related folk (including those more broadly whom are involved in such things as [[WebScience]]); there was a percieved problem about the lack of social comprehensions in relation to ontological designs; as can in-turn have the effect of perverting the ability for societies to support 'common sense' and persons to have a meaningul relationship with reality. *\n\n> *Professor Chomsky noted simply;*\n\n\"The fact that there are pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility.  The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself.\"\n\n> *Yet, as has been demonstrated more significantly in recent years; there are complex underlying factors, that i have sought to address which has the effect of feeding into the [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] designs, alongside the broader ecosystems required to support it; as, the fundamental problem becomes, that where people become disassociated as a consequence of the intended behaviours of others, then the problem becomes linked with the importance of the concept to ensure we're working on [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].*\n\n> *[[UnderstandingOntologies]] is of critical importance to gain a better comprehension about the implications and in-turn how they have a foundational basis in built upon science; that can and is in-turn exploited by bad actors (often highly sophistocated ones); as is one of the many forms of Social Attack Vectors that are becoming a greater problem due to AI infrastructure, that is not operating appropriate [[SafetyProtocols]] - or at least, that's my opinion.  Whilst others may be satisfied and/or happy with the way their ICT systems work for them; the designs brought about via the [[WebizenTechStack]] and related applied methods to address [[SocialFactors]] via [[WebScience]] and otherwise; in-turn leads to complex factors that fundamentally relate to human consciousness.   An example of the implications has sought to be illustrated by  [Henry Strapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stapp) in the simpliest way i've ever seen done, per below. *\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYPjXz1MVv0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n> *These sorts of considerations in-turn feed into the ecosystems design paradigms that are embedded into the body of works and the method of assembly relating to the ecosystems tooling, etc.*\n\n> *When considering the intended purpose of constituencies such as [[TheWebizenCharter]], the [[CommunityOfPractice]] and other [[WebizenAlliance]] [[CommercialModels]] that as stated - seek to support the growth of the far broader [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]] , Old concepts, whether they be embedded in the systems of faith that people have in all parts of the world; or via old codes of conduct as noted earlier; and indeed also, old terms such as The term Worshipful;*\n  \n  *(a) Honorable, virtuous, of noble character, estimable; highly respectable, decent; of a knight: excelling in knightly virtues, courageous, courteous, of great prowess; maken ~, to honor (sb.); \n (b) deserving of honor or respect, praiseworthy; also, ?deserving of special treatment, singular [quot. a1500(c1477)]; \n (c) of an act, a ceremony: demonstrative of due honor or respect; \n (d) renowned, eminent, famed; \n (e) bringing honor or distinction; \n (f) as noun: one who is honorable, a respectable person. \n  Source: [Middle English Compendium](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED53455) \n\n> *Which does in-turn relate to the term [The Honourable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable) as is more commonly used today.  The underlying point being that unless there are lawful means to address wrongs that are committed upon people with the express intent of causing that person injury; or indeed also, behaviours that unwittingly or mistakenly caused a person injury; unless there are lawful means to seek remedy, then there is no available means to support Peace.*  \n\n> *As such, i find myself now having to go through the difficult process of describing the nature of some of the horrible things people seemingly seek to gainfully do; involving harms to others. Many of these sorts of issues have existed for a very long time, whilst others have only become a problem or a worse problem due to newer issues.  \n\nIt is thought that the reason why many of these issues haven't been better addressed is in-part due to the sophistocated nature of what needs to occur to bring about a more comprehensive 'ecosystems solution' to address bad behaviour / bad actors.  There are various 'classes' of bad actors which are not the same as one-another.  Often they're interactive and often it is unclear which 'category' or 'agent' is best associated with which category.  \n\nDue to various forms of vulnerability and the lack of functionality provided to support [[ValuesCredentials]] - that is, the ability to support a means where people self-declare what their values frameworks are; and both, what should be expected of them and in-turn also, the relationship.\n\nSo, this document and the related group of additional documents on related topics; seeks to illustrate various types of 'attack vectors' and in-turn support the means to consider how it is this environment appropriates a mechanism to provide better 'moral security' and/or alerts and accountability measures that are intended to act in-turn to better support healthy (safe) [[Relationships(Social)]], etc.\n\n#### Description of different types of attacks\n\nWhilst work to more appropriately illustrate the somewhat exhaustive nature of how various types of attack vectors are all too often gainfully employed by bad people and those who've been misled by bad people; none of it is simple, and people who have developed to become professionals in the field employ extremely well-developed and complex methodologies to achieve their objectives - which are generally for personally gainful purposes, at the material expense of others, that may well have consequences relating to serious injury, impairment, disability and/or death of their targets.  These sorts of attacks are not simple, and can often evolve in a manner that leads to many different actors getting involved in a broader 'agenda' that serves the interest (at least initially) of the would-be beneficiary.  \n\nThe consequences are often defined by law to constitute an emboidment of actions and/or behaviours that may be thereby considered an alledged crime; and whilst the proper venue to sort these sorts of things out is a court of law, the apparatus to ensure that avenue for lawful remedy be available, is often actively discouraged by an array of parties; not simply those well known to be involved in crime and/or organised crime.  \n\n\n\n\n\n### ChatGPT Contributions\n\nGiven one of the prominently employed social attack vectors is to seek to debase the merit of a persons words and/or ability to be heard or be socially supported to be listened to; the use of ChatGPT has been used fairly extensively; including contributions for this topic also\n\n\nBelow is some content that has been generated by ChatGPT.   \n\nThere are a number of social attack vectors or behaviors that can negatively impact knowledge workers who are working online. Some examples include:\n\n1.  Character assassination: Attacking someone's character online, often through spreading false or malicious information about them, can damage their reputation and credibility, and can make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n2.  Gaslighting: Manipulating someone into doubting their own perceptions or memories, often through the use of manipulation and deception, can undermine their confidence and make it more difficult for them to speak up or advocate for themselves.\n    \n3.  Bullying: Using aggressive or abusive behavior to intimidate or dominate others can create a toxic work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n4.  Exclusion: Excluding someone from important conversations or decisions, or versioning them out of documentation that they were involved in creating, can undermine their contributions and make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Harassment, including sexual harassment, can create a hostile work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n6.  Discrimination: Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic can create an unfair and hostile work environment, and can make it more difficult for people to succeed in their careers.\n\nIt is important to recognise that these social attack vectors can have serious negative impacts on knowledge workers, and can make it more difficult for them to do their jobs effectively. They can also create a toxic work environment that is harmful to the well-being of workers.\n\nTo protect against these types of social attacks, it is important to have clear policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse, and to have processes in place for addressing and resolving conflicts. It is also important to create a culture of respect and inclusion, and to encourage open and honest communication. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive work environment for knowledge workers.\n\nIf a target of social attacks is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to law enforcement, legal and/or court processes, or due to threats or fears for their safety, it is important for their employer or organization to have policies and practices in place to protect them. This may involve providing them with additional support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n\nIt may also be necessary to take steps to protect the privacy of the individual and any other persons who may be involved in the situation. This may involve limiting the dissemination of information about the situation and taking steps to ensure that any information that is shared is done so in a way that is consistent with relevant privacy laws and regulations.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation and protect the safety of the individual and any other persons who may be involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a well-defined process in place for addressing and resolving situations where an individual is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to legal or safety considerations, and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that the individual is protected.\n\nIf law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals involved in a situation, it may be necessary to explore other options for addressing the issue. This could involve seeking assistance from other authorities or organizations, such as human rights organizations or NGOs, that may be able to provide additional support and resources.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to pursue legal action to hold law enforcement or other authorities accountable for their failure to protect the safety of the individuals involved. This could involve filing a complaint or lawsuit seeking damages or other remedies.\n\nIt is also important to consider the safety and well-being of the individuals involved and to take steps to protect them, even if law enforcement is not able to provide the necessary protection. This may involve seeking assistance from friends, family, or other trusted sources, or seeking shelter or other forms of support to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a plan in place for addressing situations where law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals, and to have the necessary resources and support available to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved.\n\nIf a person being attacked has reported the matter to law enforcement but the situation has not yet been resolved and they are subsequently attacked online publicly and/or socially, it is important for those managing online community environments to take steps to protect their human rights. This may involve:\n\n1.  Providing support and resources: It is important to provide the person with any necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n    \n2.  Ensuring their safety: It is important to take steps to ensure the safety of the person being attacked, such as by providing them with access to shelter or other forms of support.\n    \n3.  Protecting their privacy: It is important to respect the privacy of the person being attack and to take steps to protect their personal information, especially if they are unable to publish all of the evidence relating to the matter online due to legal or safety considerations.\n    \n4.  Providing a safe and inclusive environment: It is important to create a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the online community, and to have policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse.\n    \n5.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to encourage open and honest communication and to create a culture of respect and inclusion, where people feel safe and supported in sharing their experiences and concerns.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals who are being attack online and to create a more positive and supportive online community environment.\n\nIt is important to note that in order to effectively protect the human rights of individuals who are being attacked online, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities, depending on the nature of the attack and the risks to the individual's safety. It may also be necessary to seek assistance from other organizations or individuals who have expertise in addressing online attacks and can provide additional support and resources.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of relevant laws and regulations that may apply in situations where individuals are being attack online, and to take steps to ensure that the rights of the individuals involved are being protected.\n\nOverall, it is important to take a proactive approach to addressing online attacks and to have the necessary policies and resources in place to protect the human rights of those involved. This may involve providing support and resources to individuals who are being attack, creating a safe and inclusive online community environment, and working with law enforcement and other authorities to address the situation.\n\n### Commercially Motivated Attacks\nIf the underlying purpose of an attack is commercial or related to financial crimes, and the primary purpose is to obtain an advantage and/or harm the victim in a way that will prevent them from being compensated for their work and cause them injury, it is important for communities involved in work-related activities online to take steps to protect human rights and prevent harm to individuals. This may involve:\n\n1.  Having policies in place to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse: It is important to have policies in place that clearly define what types of behavior are not acceptable and provide guidance on how to report and address incidents of financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n2.  Providing support and resources to victims: It is important to provide victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse with the necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n    \n3.  Working with law enforcement and other authorities: It may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\n    \n4.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to create a culture of transparency and encourage open and honest communication within the community, as this can help to identify and address issues related to financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes.\n\nIn addition to the steps I listed earlier, there are a few other things that communities involved in work-related activities online can do to protect human rights and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes:\n\n1.  Educate members of the community: It is important to educate members of the community about financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to provide them with information about how to recognize and report these types of incidents.\n    \n2.  Promote ethical behavior: It is important to promote ethical behavior and to encourage community members to act with integrity and respect for the rights of others. This may involve establishing codes of conduct or ethical guidelines for community members to follow.\n    \n3.  Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect: It is important to create a culture of inclusivity and respect within the community, and to encourage open and respectful dialogue and debate. This can help to create a more positive and supportive environment and reduce the risk of harm to individuals.\n    \n4.  Monitor and address issues as they arise: It is important to regularly monitor the community for signs of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and to take prompt action to address any issues that are identified.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, communities can create a more positive and supportive environment for all members, and can help to protect the human rights of individuals who may be at risk of abuse.\n\nIf a case or circumstance like this cannot be openly discussed publicly due to privacy, legal, or safety reasons, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to those involved. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individuals involved.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of those involved. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy, legal, and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nIf a person is excluded, socially assaulted, and subjected to other broader social, mental, and economic harms as a result of an attack, and the circumstances of the attack cannot be discussed publicly due to privacy and safety issues, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to the person who has been harmed. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of social, mental, and economic abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of the person who has been harmed. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individual.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nThere are a number of compensation and other measures that could be considered in order to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit people who do the right thing and act in accordance with and support of human rights instruments. Some options may include:\n\n1.  Financial compensation: In cases where individuals have suffered financial harm as a result of being subjected to social attack vectors, it may be appropriate to provide financial compensation to help them recover from their losses.\n    \n2.  Legal remedies: In cases where the actions of others have violated the rights of individuals, it may be appropriate to seek legal remedies, such as damages or injunctions, to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and to provide compensation to the individuals who have been harmed.\n    \n3.  Counseling and support services: It may be necessary to provide counseling and other support services to individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors in order to help them cope with the emotional and mental trauma they may have experienced.\n    \n4.  Education and training: Providing education and training on human rights and ethical conduct can help to promote a culture of respect and inclusion, and can encourage individuals to act in accordance with these principles.\n    \n5.  Policies and procedures: Having clear policies and procedures in place to address social attack vectors and other forms of abuse can help to prevent harm to individuals and create a more positive and supportive community environment.\n    \n\nBy considering these and other measures, it is possible to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit those who do the right thing and act in support of human rights, rather than benefiting those who engage in social attack vectors for financial or social gain.\n\nIt is also important to have mechanisms in place for addressing and resolving conflicts that may arise within a community of practice, and for holding individuals accountable for their actions. This may involve having processes in place for reporting and investigating incidents of abuse or misconduct, and for taking disciplinary action as appropriate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have resources available for individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors or other forms of abuse, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n\nOverall, it is important to create a culture of respect and inclusion within a community of practice, and to have policies and procedures in place to address and prevent social attack vectors and other forms of abuse. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive environment for all members of the community and to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected and protected.\n\nA semantic web ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts and relationships within a specific domain of knowledge, using a standardized vocabulary and logical rules. In the context of managing social attack vectors, an ontology could be used to represent concepts such as:\n\n-   Social attack vector: A specific type of behavior or tactic that is used to harm or exploit others, either individually or as part of a group.\n    \n-   Human rights: The fundamental rights and freedoms that are inherent to all human beings, and which are protected under international law.\n    \n-   Financial crimes: Illegal activities that involve the misuse of financial resources or systems for personal or financial gain.\n    \n-   Counseling services: Professional services provided by trained individuals to help individuals cope with and resolve emotional, mental, or behavioral problems.\n    \n-   Legal remedies: Measures that can be taken to address and resolve legal issues, such as damages or injunctions.\n    \n\nBy defining these concepts and their relationships within an ontology, it is possible to create a structured and logical representation of the principles for managing social attack vectors, and to use this representation to support decision-making and other processes related to this domain.\n\n\n### Ontology related

It reflects an individual's beliefs, values, and assumptions about the world and their place within it, and it is shaped by their personal experiences, cultural and social context, and education.*\n\n*Personal ontologies can be complex and multifaceted, and they can vary significantly from person to person. They can also change and evolve over time as an individual's experiences and understanding of the world changes.*\n\n*In the context of AI, personal ontologies can be relevant in several ways. For example, an AI system that is designed to interact with humans may need to take into account the personal ontologies of its users in order to effectively communicate and understand their needs and preferences. In addition, the design of an AI system may be influenced by the personal ontologies of the designers, reflecting their values and assumptions about the world and the role of AI in it.*\n\n*Socio-economic influences can also shape personal ontologies, as an individual's economic and social status can shape their experiences and understanding of the world. For example, an individual's personal ontology may be influenced by their socio-economic background, their education, and the social and cultural norms that they are exposed to. Understanding these influences can be important for designing AI systems that are fair and unbiased, and that are able to effectively serve the needs of a diverse user base.*\n\n*It is also worth noting that personal ontologies can sometimes come into conflict with each other, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts. For example, two individuals with different personal ontologies may have different beliefs or assumptions about the nature of reality, leading to difficulties in communication and understanding.*\n\n*In the context of AI, it is important for designers and users to be aware of these potential conflicts and to take steps to address them. This can include designing AI systems that are able to adapt to and accommodate different personal ontologies, and engaging in dialogue and communication to build shared understanding and resolve misunderstandings.*\n\n*Overall, personal ontologies are an important aspect of human experience and understanding, and they can have significant implications for the design and use of AI systems. It is important for designers and users to be aware of personal ontologies and to consider them in the design and use of AI systems in order to ensure that they are effective and fair.*\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/ScienceOfConsciousness/","title":"Science of Consciousness"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Science of Consciousness\n\n### Introductory Remarks\nAfter many years of work; i have recently found myself involved with a group of luminary minds from around the world who are engaged in an activity that is focused upon The Science of Consciousness.  Those involved, have extrodinary skills and expertise in a variety of areas, which are in-turn associated with roles of significance internationally via various venues.  \n\nIt is my hope that members of this group may usefully contribute when it is appropriate to do so.  in the meantime, this document will seek to provide some relatively basic information.\n\n### Chat GPT\n\n> Q: How would you define the science of consiousness?\n\n*The science of consciousness is the study of the nature of consciousness, or the subjective experience of being aware of one's thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on research and theories from a range of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science.*\n\n*In the science of consciousness, researchers aim to understand the neural basis of consciousness, the relationship between the brain and consciousness, and the ways in which consciousness arises and evolves. They also study the various forms of consciousness that exist, such as wakefulness, sleep, and altered states of consciousness, and the ways in which consciousness can be altered or influenced by external factors.*\n\n*The science of consciousness is a complex and difficult field, and there is still much that is not understood about the nature of consciousness. However, advances in neuroscience and other fields have led to a greater understanding of the neural basis of consciousness, and researchers continue to make progress in understanding the nature of this elusive and fundamental aspect of human experience.*\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/UnderstandingOntologies/","title":"Understanding Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Understanding Ontologies\n\nIt seems important to describe the consequence of 'ontology' not simply from a technical level, but also from a social level...\n\nFrom a social perspective, an ontology is a shared understanding or interpretation of the world and the concepts that exist within it. It is shaped by the cultural and social context in which it is developed, and it reflects the values, beliefs, and assumptions of the people who create it.\n\nIn sociology, the concept of ontology is often used to refer to the way that individuals and groups make sense of the world and their place within it. This includes their understanding of the nature of reality, the categories and concepts that they use to make sense of the world, and the relationships between these concepts.\n\nIn social interactions, individuals and groups often have different ontologies, reflecting their different experiences and perspectives. These differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, as people may use different terms and categories to describe the same thing, or may have different assumptions about the nature of reality.\n\nHowever, ontologies can also be shared and negotiated through social interactions, as individuals and groups engage in dialogue and communication. Through these interactions, people can come to a shared understanding of the world and the concepts that exist within it, allowing them to communicate more effectively and collaborate more effectively.\n\nOne of the best examples i know of was done by [Jason Silva: Shots of Awe](https://www.youtube.com/@ShotsOfAwe) \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nA discussion about the concept\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTw3jocJBrw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n## What is Ontology Modelling?\n\nOntology modeling is the process of creating a structured representation of a domain of knowledge. An ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to define the vocabulary of a domain, as well as the types of relationships that can exist between concepts.\n\nOntologies are typically created using a formal language, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). They can be used to represent a wide range of knowledge, including scientific, medical, and even business knowledge.\n\nThere are several benefits to using ontologies in modeling a domain of knowledge. They allow for the creation of a common vocabulary that can be shared by multiple users or systems. They also enable the creation of more precise and unambiguous definitions of concepts, which can improve communication and understanding within a domain. Finally, ontologies can be used to enable automated reasoning, allowing computers to make inferences and draw conclusions based on the knowledge represented in the ontology.\n\n\nOntology employs vocabulary and is innately and somewhat inextricably linked with the mechanisms considered instrumental to consciousness; through which we organise  communications of thought and embedded concepts.  These systems lead to an implicit design of embedded ideology, values and belief systems; whether or not it is intended.  \n\n#### Semantic Web Historical Notes\n\n**Semantic Web**, extension of the [World Wide Web](https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-Wide-Web) (WWW) in which data are given meaning ([semantics](https://www.britannica.com/science/semantics)) to enable [computers](https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer) to look up and “reason” in response to user searches. One of the strongest proponents of the Semantic Web is [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tim-Berners-Lee), the British inventor of the WWW and the director of the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-Wide-Web-Consortium) (W3C), which oversees standards for the project.\n\nBerners-Lee had [envisioned](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/envisioned) the Semantic Web by at least 1994, only a few years after he began developing the WWW in 1989. He unveiled his idea for the Semantic Web at the First International WWW Conference, held in 1994, which resulted in the formation of the W3C.\n\nSource:  [britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Semantic-Web) \n\nPart of the history of this project is that it appears to have been initially supported via the DARPA related project that created [DAML](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207042906/http://www.daml.org/about.html) +[OIL](https://tomhalljones.com/web/ontology-inference-layer-oil/).  which then led to [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) that provides a top-level concept of `owl:thing`, although [[FOAF]]  (which was originally created prior to OWL) does not define a person as a a subclass of `owl:thing` although other examples of FOAF appear to have changed the semantics to include it.  This may be due to 'tool lock-ins', where some tools are designed to be specifically designed to use / work with OWL.  \n\nSome of these sorts of issues are difficult and confusing to both figure out and thereby form a comprehension about the intended designs / purpose; as the semantics matter, yet the ability to ensure comprehensible meanings - is seemingly challenged in some way; perhaps its just me, or perhaps its a broader problem, idk.  \n\nNOTE:  A great deal of these works are very much centred upon forming an information fabric that renders an environment through which Human Beings employ Tools (ie: ICT) in a manner that defines Human Beings as the primary (yet indirect) agents; not as a 'thing' but rather as 'beings'.  Whilst it appears as though these sorts of sentiments were seemingly expressed in the original [[FOAF]] works, the confusion (whether its due to my own confusion or other exteral issues or perhaps both) as to whether the predicate is `owl:thing` (whereby a person is a sub-class of thing) or whether human beings are independently represented, is not as clearly defined as is otherwise sought to be addressed.  \n\nTherein - the FOAF project was created sometime between the late 1990's and before 2001 (the history is sometimes hard to find).\n\nThe sitaution / growth of the internet at that stage; was at a very different level, as were the circumstances related to what usecases might be reasonably defined for systems of that time.\n\nSo, whilst the work done back then was indeed remarkable - and seemingly done in a manner that was mindful of - at least - the basic needs of human beings; perhaps there's validity in seeking to reinvent the modelling to uplift how future systems are made to work.\n\n#### Considerations\n\nThe High level concepts that are being considered;\n\nPresently, the primary ontological predicate is mostly `owl:thing` which thereby defines everything described by it a subclass of `thing`. Whilst this makes sense for `things`, i do not like the concept of human beings defined as a subclass of `thing` nor is it necessarily appropriate to define other parts of life as `things`; so perhaps this can be seperated as to form the logical foundations for seperating the human kind,  the thing created by humankind and things (see - not sure what other term?) of our world, particularly therein - life.\n\nThereafter; one consitituency of the considerations is how to seperate the Conceptual 'spheres'\n\nThe ontological considerations relating to humans should also support considerations about qualia and 'philosophy of mind' related considerations; whereas the [Biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere) related factors may be subject to some sort of property rights / law related assertions; but they do not exist because of mankind; rather, they are constituencies of what may be referred to as our natural world or what many would consider to be things or parts of 'god', including but not limited to - life.  This in-turn has an array of implications relating to the differences between inventions (of man) and discoveries (of / for mankind). As an extension of these considerations the term [Infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)  is thereby linked to the term [inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) which i've previously used extensively when seeking to forge appropriate namonclature to describe the informational representation of a human being, and implicitly therein - consciousness; in a manner that is not improperly disruptive to [[FreedomOfThought]].  As a consequence of previous works, i am convinced that there is a meaningful relationship between the field of study and communications of concepts broadly defined as quantum physics. Herein, as the ramifications are difficult to easily provide a mechanism for people to generally test and observe themselves; the implication of how to form meaningful insights or considerations; in so far as i have found, moreover relates to the way in which these concepts relating to physics and natural systems, are described.\n\nOne such example that is short, and therefore more useful than the longer presentations and/or lectures on the topic; is the short description provided by Henry Strapp on Quantum Mechanics and Human Consciousness; in it, strapp describes the importance of the role of the observer (the conscious agent).\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYPjXz1MVv0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nHTTP(s) based ontologies are fundamental to the Semantic Web; which has later been termed 'linked data'.  \n\nIn a w3c post; it describes linked data in the following way,\n\nTim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web and initiator of the Linked Data project, suggested a 5 star deployment scheme for Linked Data. The 5 Star Linked Data system is cumulative.

Values credentials are a type of [VerifiableClaims&Credentials](VerifiableClaims&Credentials.md).\n\nThe term 'values' is intended to denote the concept of a persons (human being or guardian) 'human values' that need to be provided the apparatus to provide support for those values.\n\nThese tools, are considered to be of instrumental importance for the development of webizen as 'peace infrastructure' both as a project, and as a toolset for the production of other projects.\n\nThe Values Credentials, provide support for how other agents are able to be managed.  Rather than the concept of 'opt-in' or 'consent', the concept of 'values credentials' relates to 'human agency', and the ability and desirability for human beings as foundationally important active natural agents, to make wilful choices about how it is they want to organise their life; and in-turn also, how it is they're able to track and improve their own quality of being, and the growth of themselves as a person.  \n\nUsers are able to use values credentials, to help them curate how they interact with other agents; and can even provide support for excluding themselves from other agents

exist.  The future [[TheValuesProject]] outcome is prodominately designed to provide the software required for people to more respectfully engage in contracts with others online directly between one another; and in-turn, they are also able to vary their agreements and make their own independent decisions about what to do in circumstances where values have been breached.  To enable these systems, more work needs to be done during this development stage.  As such, the ability to engender agency for persons in a manner that is considered [[FitForPurpose]] is not able to be better achieved until the technology that furnishes the means to do so, has been successfully accumplished. As such, the notes about the present-development stage is of instrumental importance until it is otherwise declared.\n\n#### The present development stage\n\n[[TemporalSemantics]] are kinda useful, so i'll make a note as of the time that i am now therefore writing this note. These notes will be updated overtime, and the information will be supplimented rather than replaced - save exceptional circumstances, etc.\n\n##### 3rd Feb 2023: notes\n\nPursuant to the notes made in the [[GuideForDevelopers]] and related [[WebizenTerms]] which is now therefore being developed primarily to support the [[WebizenDiscord]] channel; where there are conflicting values that are otherwise noted in one or more of the values related instruments noted above; a degree of [[BestEfforts]] to form a common-sense opinion / position, is overwhelmingly considered desirable.  IF persons are unable to bind themselves to the general concepts that are emboided in these instruments, then do not get involved.  Persons who are known to have wilfully acted in a manner that has sought to commit wrongs such as those described by the notes on [[SocialAttackVectors]] may be subject to [[banishmentExile]] without notice and without further regard, irraspective of employer or any other factor that may otherwise discriminatorily fail to adhere to the foundational principals described in the instruments above.  \n\n#### Once webizen systems are operational.\n\n### Arbitration of conflicting values.\n\nThe arbitration of matters involving alledged wrongs will be processed in accordance with the [[WebizenTerms]] stipulations; until such time as [[TheWebizenCharter]] and corralated [[WebizenAlliance]] infrastructure is able to be established; which in-turn requires a functional [[WebizenTechStack]] implementation, which is the purposeful activity that gives rise to the purpose of having written this and other notes here. \n\n[[BestEfforts]] are to be undertaken at all times, however, all rights are reserved.\n\n`#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/WhatAreTheCommons/","title":"What are 'The Commons'"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# What are 'The Commons'\n\n## Introductions\n\n*The Legal intepretation of the term 'commons' is defined as Something that is common is **owned equally by two or more people**, such as a piece of land. A Tenancy in Common is an interest in land wherein at least two people share ownership.* \n\nSource: [legal dictionary](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/common)\n\n#### The Moral Considerations\nIn-effect, the consideration related to the design of [[Webizen]] and [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]] related works was, that in-order to protect [[FreedomOfThought]] there needed to be a series of designs to support both [[HumanCentricAI]] and in-turn the manifestation of [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] in a way that supported the [[NoLock-ins]] and broader [[SafetyProtocols]] built into the ecosystems.  In-effect, as is one of the many topics of [[TheValuesProject]] the ability for people to have their fundamental human rights supported in a way that supports principals such as privacy and moreover the requirements people have in-order to support human dignity.  This requires a means to decentralise the publically consumable knowledge of mankind in such a way that provides us, members of our human family as beneficiaries of these bodies of knowledge; to in-effect, be furnished a means to make use of that information using modern societal tools in a way that does not require us to submit to unwanted abuses of human rights. \n\n#### The SocioEconomic Factors\n\nThe way 'commons' information has been developed for use on internet is now highly centralised, not simply at the level of which websites but moreover which jurisitictions; leading to a circumstance where our ability to define reality is highly dependant upon the few persons involved in making laws in one place on earth which have repercussive effects globally.  This is a well known characteristic for many who are significantly involved.\n\nMany of these websites continue to present requests for financial donations to be provided to support their services; and whilst it is absolutely the case that these services are essential, they have also been designed in a particular way which leads to a significant responsibility. \n\nThese systems of donations do not equally consider how the human labour of those involved in creating the materials might also be considered work; and good work, should be paid - but not paid in perpetuiety (ie: not subject to royalties); which in-turn leads to a few mechanisms that manifest, the first is that 'commons' materials become more easily targeted (increasingly on a programmatic basis) by bad actors (humans, organisations, software / AI) to change the records of what humanity depends upon as knowledge, to suit agendas relating to some particular issue that might be happening at any given time.  Given these systems are unlike books; the content can be changed whenever and the ability to see the history is not easy.\n\nOverall; there are a few variables that relate to issues that have manifested as a consequence of the 'commons' now becoming managed by systems that are so globally centralised legally.\n\n### The Technical Factors\n\nIn-order to support [[HumanCentricAI]] and [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] commons information needs to be formatted into [[SemanticWeb]] standards related formats, and this should be done in a way where it is clear who defined the content of the resource (ie: a human being, a company or legal entity or a software agent); and then it needs to be able to be processed locally, without providing constant updates to the providers of any such resources that are essential for the use of computing systems in life.  \n\n## Introductory Summary\n\n> Imagine if, we were only able to be entitled to use the English Language if we agreed to use a spell-checker that constantly provided to an `overlord` the information we generate about everything that we were using the english language to perform, as a requirement for using the english language...   \n> \n> This is one of many constituencies to the far broader 'commons' which permissive commons systems seek to ensure, are able to be used locally without providing any one any information about how we're using it at the time when we're using it; whilst then also, providing a means to create AI related functionality for the things that we end-up sharing with others; once we've decided to do so, and only in relation to the use of those works in relation to whomever it is we've decided to share it with.  \n\n\n## External References\n\nBelow are some definitions sourced elsewhere...\n\n#### WikiPedia: Commons\n\nThe **commons** is the [cultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture \"Culture\") and [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature \"Nature\") resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable Earth. These resources are held in common even when owned privately or publicly. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism.[cite 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-ReferenceA-1) Commons can also be [defined as a social practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#Commoning_as_a_process \"Commons\")[cite 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-:0-2) of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates.[cite 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-3) \n\n\n### Wikipedia: Digital commons\n\nMain article: [Digital commons (economics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics) \"Digital commons (economics)\")\n\n[Mayo Fuster Morell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Fuster_Morell \"Mayo Fuster Morell\") proposed a definition of digital commons as \"information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity. Additionally, the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources.\"[cite 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-23)[Cite 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-24)\n\nExamples of digital commons are [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia \"Wikipedia\"), [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software \"Free software\") and [open-source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware \"Open-source hardware\") projects.\n\nSource: [WikiPedia: Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)\n\nSource: [WikiPedia: Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)\n\n### Wikipedia: Digital commons (economics)\n\nThe **digital commons** are a form of [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons \"Commons\") involving the distribution and communal ownership of [informational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology \"Information technology\") and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology \"Technology\").

It combines elements of computer science, information science, sociology, economics, and other disciplines to understand the complex social, technical, and economic systems that make up the web.\n\nWeb Science researchers study topics such as the structure and evolution of the web, the impact of the web on society and culture, and the ways in which the web can be used to support research, education, and business. They also study the technical and social challenges associated with building and maintaining the web, such as privacy, security, and misinformation.\n\nWeb Science is a relatively new field, and it is still evolving. However, it is an important area of study, as the web and the internet have become increasingly central to many aspects of modern life, and understanding their impact and potential is crucial for both academia and society as a whole.\n\nWeb Science research often involves the use of computational methods and data analysis to study the web and the internet. This can include the use of machine learning algorithms, network analysis techniques, and data visualization tools to understand patterns and trends on the web.\n\nWeb Science also often involves the use of qualitative methods, such as interviews and surveys, to understand the human experience of the web. This can include studying the ways in which people use the web, the impact of the web on society and culture, and the ways in which people interact with each other online.\n\nWeb Science research often focuses on a range of different domains, including social media, e-commerce, online education, and health care. It is an interdisciplinary field, and researchers often collaborate with experts from a variety of fields, such as computer science, sociology, and economics, to tackle complex problems and issues related to the web.\n\nOverall, Web Science is a broad and rapidly evolving field, with a focus on understanding the complex social, technical, and economic systems that make up the web, and the ways in which these systems impact society and individuals.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n### A Quick Introduction to the concept of Social Machines\n\nThe Luminary in the field, James Hendler, wrote a book about [\"Social Machines: The Coming Collision of Artificial Intelligence, Social Networking, and Humanity\"](https://g.co/kgs/FjikkY) .  \n\nBelow is a video that is available in relation to his works sometime ago, that may make more sense to others now...\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVkhX5t98Ls\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIMHO: Generally speaking, the field of work that is structured to in-turn make use of the deep knowledge of different diciplinary areas of thoughtful consideration, as to support the growth of a form of intentional design - in activities that relate to the fabrication of technologies that societies become inextricably linked to, is described as 'Web Science'.\n\nWeb Science works, is in-particular - a significant part of the field of work of Web Civics.  \n\nOne of the greatest areas of 'Web Science' is AI and in-turn also, the work i've been doing that is in-turn instrumental to the architecture of Webizen, as to support [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]].   Nonetheless, the underlying nature of Webizen is that it is a form of Social Machine that is sought to be intentionally designed to provide the sorts of Artificial Minds that we want, rather than providing an opportunity to be influenced by harmful robots. \n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/AgentLabelling/AgentLabellingChatGPT/","title":"Agent Labelling"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n# Agent Labelling\n\nIt is important that there is a clear means to distinguish between the content, information or processes and decisions that are made by Software Agents (AI) Vs. those made by legal entities; and in-turn also, the ability to dertermine which specific human beings were involved in many or causing any sort of causality related action to occur.\n\nAsking ChatGPT;\n\nMy Question:\nWhat are the sorts of dangers, threats and social attack vectors that may occur if human beings are falsely led to believe they are consuming the work of other human beings or legal entities; when in-fact they're consuming information generated via an artificial intelligence software program?\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n*There are several dangers and threats that may occur if individuals are falsely led to believe that they are consuming information generated by other human beings or legal entities when it is actually generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) program. Some of these include:*\n\n-   Misinformation and disinformation: AI-generated content can be used to spread false or misleading information, which can have negative effects on individuals and society at large.\n    \n-   Manipulation and influence: AI-generated content can be used to manipulate individuals and groups by appealing to their emotions, biases, and prejudices.\n    \n-   Privacy and security concerns: AI-generated content can be used to target individuals with personalized phishing, scams, and other malicious attacks.\n    \n-   Dehumanization and mistrust: People being exposed to AI generated content that is falsely presented as being generated by human could lead to mistrust in human-generated content, leading towards a dehumanization of human expression as well as a mistrust in human-generated content, AI-generated content can be used to perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce societal biases.\n    \n-   Interfere with legal process: AI-generated content can be used to impersonate people or entities for fraudulent activities or illegal activities and could interfere with legal proceedings.\n    \n\n*Overall, it is important for individuals to be able to distinguish between AI-generated content and human-generated content in order to make informed decisions and to protect themselves from potential dangers.*\n\n*Another potential danger of falsely believing that information is generated by human beings when it is actually generated by AI is that it may lead to a lack of critical thinking and evaluation of the information being consumed. If people believe that the information they are consuming is coming from a trusted source, they may be less likely to fact-check or critically evaluate it. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, as well as a decrease in people's ability to make well-informed decisions.*\n\n*Additionally, there may be ethical concerns associated with the use of AI-generated content, particularly when it is used to impersonate human beings or legal entities. The ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-generated content raises questions about consent and accountability, as well as potential harms that may be caused by the use of this technology.*\n\n*Finally, the widespread use of AI-generated content has the potential to disrupt various industries and change the way people think about and interact with information. It could change how professional authors, journalists, and creative professionals work, which could have both positive and negative impacts on the economy and society.*\n\nMy Question: \nWhat are some of the threats related to circumstances where government departments and/or employees may use Artificial Intelligence to act in a manner that has human rights implications in relation to the effect of those actions if it is not clearly labelled to have been done via an AI Agent?\n\n\nChatGPT Answer: \n\n*If government departments or employees use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a way that has human rights implications and it is not clearly labeled as having been done by an AI agent, there could be several threats. Some of these include:*\n\n-   *Discrimination and bias: If an AI system is not transparent in its decision-making processes, it may perpetuate discrimination and bias against certain individuals or groups, potentially violating their human rights.*\n    \n*-   Lack of accountability: If an AI system is used to make decisions or take actions that have human rights implications, it can be difficult to hold individuals or organizations accountable if the system is not clearly labeled as an AI agent and its decision-making process is opaque.*\n    \n-   *Due process concerns: If an AI system is used to make decisions that affect an individual's rights or freedoms, it may not always provide the same level of due process protections as a human decision-maker. This could lead to violations of human rights and the rule of law.*\n    \n-   *Privacy and security: If an AI system is used to process personal data without proper regulation or oversight, it could lead to privacy violations, security breaches, and other harms.*\n    \n-   *Lack of transparency: If the actions of an AI agent is not clearly labeled, it can make it difficult for people to understand how decisions are being made, which could lead to mistrust and lack of transparency.*\n    \n*-   Interference with human autonomy: If an AI agent make decisions that have significant impact on human life, people may lose their autonomy on the decision making process and their right to self-determination.*\n    \n\n*Overall, it is crucial that government departments and employees are transparent in their use of AI, clearly label any decisions or actions that are made by an AI agent, and ensure that the AI systems they use are fair, accountable, and respect human rights.*\n\n*Another potential threat is that the AI may have unintended consequences on human rights, if it not properly implemented, tested, and monitored. Even if the AI system is not inherently biased, the data it is trained on may be biased, leading to unjust outcomes.*\n\n*Additionally, if the use of AI is not transparent and the decision-making processes of the AI system are not explainable, it may be difficult for people to understand how the decisions are being made and to challenge them if they believe that their human rights are being violated.*\n\n*Moreover, if AI agents are used in law enforcement or security, without proper oversight or regulation, there could be a risk that the AI systems may be used to infringe on individuals’ rights, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, or to target certain groups based on their ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs.*\n\n*It is important that the use of AI by government departments and employees is subject to proper regulation and oversight, so that human rights are protected and that the actions of the AI systems can be transparently tracked and audited.*\n\n*Finally, It is crucial that the AI system are continuously monitored and evaluated for their impacts on human rights and adjustments or replacements are made if necessary*.\n\nMy Question:\nwhat are some of the potential risks in circumstances relating to foreign governments? \n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\nThere are several potential risks in circumstances related to foreign governments using AI:\n\n-   Cyber espionage: Foreign governments may use AI to conduct cyber espionage or cyberattacks against other countries, potentially stealing sensitive information or disrupting critical infrastructure.\n    \n-   Misinformation and disinformation: Foreign governments may use AI-generated content to spread false or misleading information, with the intention of manipulating public opinion or undermining the credibility of other governments.\n    \n-   Interference in domestic politics: Foreign governments may use AI to interfere in the domestic politics of other countries, with the goal of swaying elections or influencing policy decisions.\n    \n-   Economic espionage: Foreign governments may use AI to gain an unfair advantage in international trade, by collecting business intelligence and targeting specific industries or companies.\n    \n-   Military advantage: Foreign governments may use AI to enhance their military capabilities, potentially threatening the stability of regions and global security\n    \n-   Human Rights abuse: AI technology has been used by some governments to track and control their citizens, violating their privacy and freedom. This technology can also be used to identify and monitor individuals based on their ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs, leading to further human rights violations.\n    \n\nOverall, the use of AI by foreign governments has the potential to destabilize international relations and threaten the security and sovereignty of other countries. It is important for governments to be aware of these risks and to take steps to protect against them, through international cooperation, regulation, and diplomacy.\n\nAnother potential risk is that foreign governments may use AI in a way that violates international law or human rights. For example, they may use AI-enabled surveillance to target political opponents, or use autonomous weapons to target civilians in warfare. These actions can have significant negative consequences on human rights and global security.\n\nMoreover, the increasing use of AI in economic and technological fields may lead to a power imbalance between countries that have access to advanced AI technology and those that do not, leading to further economic and societal inequality.\n\nFurthermore, if AI is not controlled and regulated properly, foreign governments may use it to violate international norms, such as economic sanctions or arms control agreements.\n\nLastly, foreign governments may also use AI to target individuals, companies or countries with cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns for political, economic, or military gain.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial for countries to work together through international organizations and agreements to establish norms and regulations for the responsible development and use of AI, as well as to cooperate on matters of cyber security, disinformation, and human rights.\n\n\nMy Question:\n\nWhat are some of the ways AI content and/or software actions could be clearly labelled and associated with the legal entity involved and responsible for that AI content and/or software action, including both any legal personality (ie: government department, institution, corporation or business, ) as well as the specific natural legal entities / individuals (human beings) who were instrumentally involved in enabling or rendering the applied use of AI for the particular artifact or event?\n\nChatGPT Answer;\n\nThere are several ways that AI content and/or software actions can be clearly labeled and associated with the legal entity responsible for them, including both the legal personality (e.g. government department, institution, corporation or business) and the specific natural legal entities/individuals who were involved in enabling or using the AI for the particular artifact or event. Some of these methods include:\n\n-   Digital Signatures: Using digital signatures to verify the authenticity of AI content or software actions, and to link them to the legal entity or individual responsible for them.\n    \n-   Attribution Statements: Including an attribution statement in the AI content or software that identifies the legal entity or individual responsible for it.\n    \n-   Watermarking: Watermarking AI content or software with unique identifiers that can be used to trace it back to the legal entity or individual responsible for it.\n    \n-   Logging: Keeping detailed logs of who had access to and used the AI system, and what actions they took.\n    \n-   Transparency Reports: Publishing transparency reports that provide information on the legal entities and individuals involved in the development and use of AI, as well as the system's decision-making processes and any human rights considerations.\n    \n-   Certifications: Certifying the AI system by a third-party, that verifies that the system meets certain standards, such as fairness and transparency\n    \n-   Source codes or system architecture: Making the source codes or system architecture of AI systems available for public inspection, in order for third parties to verify how the systems make decisions.\n    \n-   Human oversight: Ensuring that AI systems are designed with human oversight and decision-making capabilities to make adjustments or corrections if necessary, and keeping records of those adjustments or corrections.\n    \n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that the AI system are clearly labeled and that the legal entity or individual responsible for the system is easily identifiable and can be held accountable for its actions. This can be achieved through a combination of technical and organizational measures, such as the ones listed above, which should be chosen according to the specific context and the potential impacts of the system.\n\nAnother way of clearly labelling AI content and/or software actions and associating them with the legal entity responsible for them, is by using blockchain technology, it can enable the creation of an immutable and transparent record of the origin and usage of the AI content or software. This can enable users to verify the authenticity of the content and trace it back to the legal entity or individual that created it, providing a tamper-proof record of the development and usage of the AI system.\n\nAnother approach to clearly identify the responsible entity is by using standard data labels, like the \"metadata\" of digital files, AI artifacts should also have standard labels that clearly identify the legal entity or individual responsible for them, such as the developer, creator, owner, or operator.\n\nAdditionally, governments could also play a role in promoting transparency and accountability of AI systems by implementing regulations and guidelines on the labeling of AI content and software actions, and enforcing penalties for non-compliance.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that it is not just a technical problem but also a societal one, and that it requires a multi-stakeholder approach, which includes industry, civil society, and government, to develop a solution and to ensure that it is effectively implemented.\n\nAnother way of clearly labeling AI content and/or software actions is by using certification systems. These systems involve an independent third party, such as a regulatory agency or industry group, evaluating the AI system and verifying that it meets certain standards, such as transparency, fairness, and accountability. These certifications can be used to clearly label the AI system and to provide assurance to users that the system has been independently reviewed and found to be trustworthy.\n\nAnother way of clearly labelling AI content and/or software actions is by using explainable AI (XAI) techniques, these techniques allow the AI system to explain its decision-making process to users in a way that is easy for humans to understand. This can help users to trust the system and to understand how it makes decisions, and also make it easier for legal entities or individuals to be held accountable for the actions of the system.\n\nFinally, it is important to educate the public about the importance of clearly labeling AI content and/or software actions and associating them with the legal entity responsible for them. This can help to increase awareness of the risks associated with AI and to promote responsible use of the technology.\n\nIn summary, there are many methods for clearly labelling AI content and/or software actions and associating them with the legal entity responsible for them, such as digital signatures, attribution statements, watermarking, logging, transparency reports, certifications, blockchain, standard data labels, explainable AI (XAI) and education. These methods can be used in combination to provide a comprehensive approach to transparency and accountability of AI systems.\n\nMy Question:\nHow might an ontology using RDF and common vocabularies be defined to provide a means to deploy these sorts of solutions? Can you give me an example of an RDF OWL ontology?\n\nAn ontology using RDF and common vocabularies can provide a structured way to describe and represent information related to the legal entity responsible for AI content and/or software actions, as well as the actions themselves. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a standard for modeling information on the web, and it provides a way to express the relationships between resources (e.g. documents, people, and concepts) using a graph-based structure.\n\nA simple example of an RDF OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology for describing AI content and software actions could include classes such as \"AI system\", \"Legal entity\", \"Individual\", \"Action\", and \"Responsibility\". Each class would have a set of properties that describe their characteristics and relationships, such as \"name\", \"developer\", \"owner\", \"operator\", \"decision-making process\" and \"Standards met\", respectively.\n\nFor example, the class \"AI system\" could have properties such as \"name\", \"developer\", \"owner\", \"operator\" and \"decision-making process\". The class \"Legal entity\" would have properties such as \"name\", \"type\" (e.g. government department, institution, corporation or business), \"location\", and \"jurisdiction\". The class \"Individual\" would have properties such as \"name\" and \"role\" (e.g. developer, owner, operator). The class \"Action\" would have properties such as \"name\", \"date\", \"type\" (e.g. decision, action) and \"outcome\". The class \"Responsibility\" would have properties such as \"level\" (e.g. primary, secondary, etc) and \"entity\" (e.g. legal entity, individual)\n\nThese classes and properties can be interconnected to describe complex relationships between AI systems, legal entities, individuals, and actions, and can be used to trace the origin and usage of AI content and software actions, and to establish accountability and transparency. The use of common vocabularies, such as schema.org and others, would help to standardize the representation of the information and make it more easily understandable and usable by different systems and applications.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is just a simple example and that a more comprehensive ontology would be more complex and take into account the specific context and use case. And that, the use of RDF and OWL enables the use of formal reasoning to infer new information from the ontology, which is particularly useful for the transparency and accountability of AI systems.\n\nAdditionally, using RDF and OWL to represent an ontology can enable the use of formal reasoning to infer new information from the ontology, this is particularly useful for transparency and accountability of AI systems. For example, by creating inferences rules in the ontology, you can automatically infer information about the legal entities, individuals and actions responsible for an AI system, based on the properties of the AI system.\n\nMoreover, using RDF and OWL in this context can also enable the integration of the ontology with other systems, such as databases, document management systems and even other AI systems. This is particularly useful for creating transparency and accountability solutions, where information about AI systems, legal entities and individuals need to be shared and combined across different systems.\n\nAnother advantage of using RDF and OWL is that they can leverage the Linked Data ecosystem, which allows for easy data sharing and integration across different organizations and domains. This allows for more collaboration between different stakeholders, like industry, civil society and government, to help ensure the transparency and accountability of AI systems.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that creating an ontology is just a first step, the ontology itself should be continuously updated, maintained, and evaluated to make sure it is still useful and useful, to address the complexity and dynamic nature of the field of AI.\n\nMy Question:\n\ncan you write an example in notation3 syntax.\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\nSure, here is an example of an RDF ontology written in Notation3 (N3) syntax to describe an AI system and its responsible legal entities and individuals:\n\n``` \n@prefix ai: <http://example.com/ontology/ai#> .\n@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n@prefix org: <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#> .\n\nai:MyAI a ai:AI;\n    ai:name \"My AI System\";\n    ai:developer [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name \"John Doe\" ];\n    ai:owner [ a org:Organization; org:name \"Acme Inc.\" ];\n    ai:operator [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name \"Jane Smith\" ];\n    ai:decision-makingProcess \"Explainable AI using Decision Trees\" .\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the ontology defines a class \"AI\" (ai:AI) and an instance of that class \"MyAI\" (ai:MyAI), it also specifies that \"MyAI\" has a name \"My AI System\", a developer \"John Doe\" (foaf:Person), an owner \"Acme Inc.\" (org:Organization), an operator \"Jane Smith\" (foaf:Person) and a decision-making process \"Explainable AI using Decision Trees\"\n\nThis ontology uses prefixes to simplify the URIs (ai:, foaf:, org:) used in the statements. The prefixes indicate that the URIs in the ontology are from the given namespace, so \"ai:AI\" refers to the URI \"[http://example.com/ontology/ai#AI](http://example.com/ontology/ai#AI)\".\n\nNote that this is a simplified example, in real-world scenarios, the ontology would likely have more classes and properties and also, would relate to other ontologies to provide more context and meaning, such as time, location, standards met, etc.\n\nAdditionally, the ontology can include more classes and properties such as \"Action\", \"Responsibility\", \"Jurisdiction\", \"Location\", \"Date\", \"Standards\", \"Certification\" and \"TransparencyReports\" that describe the actions taken by the AI system, the level of responsibility of the legal entities and individuals, the jurisdiction, location, date of action, standards met, certifications achieved and transparency reports respectively.\n\nHere's an example of how these classes and properties can be added to the ontology:\n\n```\n@prefix ai: <http://example.com/ontology/ai#> .\n@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n@prefix org: <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nai:MyAI a ai:AI;\n    ai:name \"My AI System\";\n    ai:developer [ a foaf:Person;

Therein - These works are not sought to be employed to deploy AI Agents that act in a [[NobodyAI]] like manner / methodology; and particular protections are sought to be forged in-order to ensure that my works are not employed for those purposes.  \n\nThese objectives form constituencies to the requirements for [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].\n\n### Further Notes about Webizen\n\nHistorical works sought to produce what i called a 'knowledge banking' ecosystem methodology; which was dependant upon the useful employment of what was in-effect a belief - that organisations would want to usefully support human agency and support the fundamental requirements necessary, in-order to do so; and in-turn, gainfully benefit via the operation of infrastructure that supported those requirements.  Yet, this isn't what happened.\n\nThe commercial deployment of works, particularly those around 'Digital Identity' specifically excluded support for; what is essentially about -human right, even though, the consequence of doing so engendered what is in-effect a choice to institutionally support  [[SocialAttackVectors]].   Within these systems the 'agent' was intended to support the requirements for, what is now being illustrated as  Human Centric Ontology. However the means to achieve that well, is seemingly produced via the work done on the [[Sense]] project.\n\nSO, whilst motified; and subject to on-going harms by people who - i consider simply, to be bad people - i went about trying to figure out how to define this ontology, which involved engaging in debate about it with leading minds world-wide via forum focused on the science of consciousness and all sorts of weird and wonderful advanced concepts therein.  This then led to debates about issues that limited the means to form productive works in the field.\n\nAs is required to support [[FreedomOfThought]] and [[HumanCentricAI]], etc.  which in-turn led to an epiphany; which was, that the issues with `owl:thing` goes away to some-degree, if the mission is to produce a method whereby persons are made able to 'buy' (and own) their own 'robots' (ai).  By shifting from the impossible situation of having to contend with well funded adverseries who had absolutely no interest whatsoever in [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] (indeed, arguably they're seeking the opposite - whilst simultaniously seeking others to believe that they're doing so, gainfully, only because of other people); away from a persons 'digital twin', or the digital emboidment of a persons existance and all related records; towards an alternative, that was about how we define an 'ai agent' that is an emboidment of what we want to have, own and 'interact' with our lives, the situation pivoted in a fairly remarkable way.  This then led to my realisation, that this is what i needed to do with the old term 'webizen' that i had formerally used, and consequentially 'saved' webizen.org to do something good with in future.   \n\nIn the end; the Webizen, is the artificial intelligence agent that is designed to support the needs of its owner; and if the owner is a legal entity (ie: company, etc. group entity); then it must interact with other webizen, that are owned by the individuals (human beings) these systems (tools) are intended to support; as the conduit of responsibility for our biosphere.\n\nIn-order to make these 'robots' work; there needs to be a method to define 'core logic' and related systems requirements.  The development of Cognative AI ecosystem components is critical to the realisation of those goals.   \n\nWhilst Human Beings naturally develop a comprehension about many things; including natural language,\n\nRobots (software) is able to develop comprehension about many computational things.  \n\n![[differences.jpeg]]\n\nThe objective is to seek to produce personal and private AI Agents (webizen) that are equipped to support doing the tasks, that human beings are not best equipped to do. \n\nIn-effect, its a long-way down the track from the time where electronic caculators were introduced and made usable by students in schools, etc.  \n\n![[nocloud.jpg]]\n\nYet presently, the use of advanced AI generally requires interactions to be performed via 3rd party systems that are - somewhat 'global' in nature; fundamentally, these systems are not 'private' and there's an array of implications that is likely to lead some people towards seeking an alternative.  As part of these systems, seeking to provide an alternative, there needs to be some processing of complex logic in-order to support most linked requirements.\n\n## Description of CogAI \n\nCognitive artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of AI that is designed to mimic the cognitive abilities of humans, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language processing. It is based on the idea that the human brain is a computational system that can be emulated by a machine, and it seeks to build AI systems that can perform tasks that require human-like cognition.\n\nCognitive AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, and machine vision, which allow machines to learn from data, understand and generate human language, and perceive and understand the visual world in a way that is similar to humans. These technologies can be applied in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, education, and customer service, to assist humans in making decisions, providing personalized recommendations, and completing tasks more efficiently.\n\nHowever, cognitive AI also raises ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for automation to displace human workers, the need for transparency and explainability in AI decision-making, and the potential for AI to perpetuate and amplify biases present in the data used to train it. As a result, the development and use of cognitive AI requires careful consideration of these issues and the responsible design and deployment of these technologies.\n\n### UseCases\n\nSome of the initial use-cases for CogAI will include the [[TheValuesProject]] and in-turn therein,  the ability to process a multitude of [[ValuesCredentials]] and in-turn provide support for Webizen Owners to evaluate whether and/or how an activity may be compliant, compatible and/or promotional of those values or whether and how there may be some sort of conflict.  \n\n### Requirements\n\nThere must be an open-standards way to perform these sorts of procedural knowledge representation tasks.  This will in-turn support productivity and reduce and/or clarify risks associated with behaviours and/or activities.\n\nThe Area has an array of very complex requirements; however fundamentally, the Web Science related requirement, is to figure out how to form a #HumanCentric Approach; so that, whilst the tools may offer suggestions and/or support, it is fundamentally still only humans that are responsible for making decisions and not Active Artificial Agents ( #AI )\n\n### W3C Cognative AI CG \n\nWork to produce an open-standard for Cognative AI is being undertaken now in the [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \n\n\"The real world is frustratingly uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent. This is challenging for traditional approaches to information systems, and a new paradigm is needed that combines symbolic and statistical techniques, building upon decades of work in the cognitive sciences, and over 500 million years of natural selection. This will allow us to create cognitive agents that learn and reason based upon prior knowledge and past experience, and which can satisfy the need for, transparency in decision making, and continuous learning for adapting to ever changing needs. This community group will address opportunities for cognitive agents using graphs, statistics, rules and graph algorithms, starting with an amalgam of RDF and Property Graphs, together with Web architecture for cognitive databases.\"\n\nSource:  [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \n\nNote also the GitHub link for the [CogAI](https://github.com/w3c/cogai/).\n\n## CogAI as a toolchain for Cognitive Databases\n\n### What are Cognative Databases?\n\n**Description by ChatGPT**\nA cognitive database is a type of database that can understand natural language queries and extract meaning from unstructured data. It uses techniques from artificial intelligence and natural language processing to analyze and understand the data stored within the database, making it more easily accessible to users. This allows for more efficient and accurate data retrieval, as well as the ability to perform more complex queries and analysis.\n\nCognitive databases can also learn and adapt over time, by analyzing user interactions and feedback to improve the accuracy of its analysis and responses. Additionally, they can provide insights and recommendations based on the data they have analyzed, and can even generate natural language responses to user queries.\n\nCognitive databases are increasingly being used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and retail, to help organizations better understand and make use of the large amounts of data they collect. They can also be used to improve customer service by allowing customers to interact with the database using natural language, rather than having to learn a specific query language.\n\nIt's important to note that cognitive databases are still relatively new and there is ongoing research to improve their capabilities and make them more widely adopted.\n\nMy Question: What is the datastructure for a cognative database?\n\nThe data structure for a cognitive database can vary depending on the specific implementation and the type of data being stored. However, some common elements include:\n\n1.  A structured data layer: This layer typically stores structured data in tables or columns, similar to a traditional relational database.\n    \n2.  An unstructured data layer: This layer is used to store unstructured data such as text, images, and audio. It can be stored in various forms such as raw text, XML, JSON and etc.\n    \n3.  A semantic layer: This layer is used to extract meaning from the unstructured data and provide a way to query it using natural language.\n    \n4.  A machine learning layer: This layer can be used to train machine learning models to understand the data and improve the accuracy of the database's analysis and responses.\n    \n5.  A knowledge graph: This layer is used to store the relationships between data entities and make it easy to traverse the data.\n    \n6.  A natural language processing (NLP) layer: This layer is used to analyze and understand natural language text, such as that found in user queries or unstructured data. It can be used to extract entities, sentiment, and intent from text and make it more easily searchable and understandable.\n    \n7.  A reasoning layer: This layer can be used to reason over the data and make inferences based on it. It can help the database understand the context of a query and provide more accurate responses.\n    \n8.  An ontology layer: This layer can be used to represent the concepts and relationships in the data using a formal ontology. This can be used to help the database understand the meaning of the data and make it more easily searchable.\n    \n9.  A visualization layer: This layer can be used to display the data in a meaningful way, such as through charts, graphs, or maps. This can make it easier for users to understand and interact with the data.\n    \n\nIt's important to note that the specific data structure of a cognitive database will depend on the particular implementation and the use case. The key feature is that it can understand and extract meaning from unstructured data, making it more easily accessible to users.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all cognitive databases will include all of these elements and the specific data structure may vary depending on the application and the specific use case.\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/CognitiveAI/DefeasibleLogic/","title":"Defeasible Logic"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Defeasible Logic\n\nNOTES:  \nDefeasible logic, originally created by Donald Nute with a particular concern about efficiency and implementation, is a simple and efficient rule based non-monotonic formalism.

In-order to provide some background resources are provided via the [GitHub link for this CG](https://github.com/w3c/cogai#positioning-relative-to-existing-approaches-to-ai).  In-order to get a more generic summary, i've queried ChatGPT.\n\n### ChatGPT Notes\n\nMy Question: Define Plausible Reasoning as it relates to Cognative AI Agents?\n\n***ChatGPT Answer:***\n\nPlausible reasoning refers to the ability of a cognitive AI agent to generate reasonable and likely explanations for a given situation or problem, based on the information and knowledge it has been trained on. It involves understanding the context of a problem and applying relevant knowledge and reasoning techniques to generate a plausible solution or explanation. This type of reasoning is important in tasks such as natural language understanding, decision making, and problem solving.\n\nPlausible reasoning is a form of probabilistic reasoning, which means that the AI agent considers multiple possible explanations and assigns a probability to each one based on the available evidence. This allows the agent to deal with uncertainty and make decisions based on the best available information.\n\nIn natural language understanding, for example, a cognitive AI agent with plausible reasoning capabilities would be able to understand the meaning of a sentence, even if it contains ambiguities or missing information. It would generate multiple possible interpretations of the sentence and choose the most likely one based on the context and the available knowledge.\n\nIn decision making, a cognitive AI agent with plausible reasoning capabilities would be able to make informed decisions, even in situations where the available information is incomplete or uncertain. It would consider multiple possible outcomes and choose the one that is most likely to achieve the desired goal.\n\nIn summary, plausible reasoning allows cognitive AI agents to generate reasonable and likely explanations or solutions based on incomplete or uncertain information. It is an important aspect of artificial intelligence research and is crucial for building intelligent agents that can operate in real-world environments.\n\n***My Question:***\n\nwhat fields of mathematics are used to design cognitive AI Plausible Reasoning software systems that are designed to work with Semtantic Web technologies such as RDF and RDFS, etc.\n\n***ChatGPT Answer:***\n\nCognitive AI systems that are designed to work with semantic web technologies such as RDF and RDFS typically use a combination of mathematical techniques from several fields, including:\n\n1.  Graph theory: RDF and RDFS use a graph-based data model, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between entities. Graph theory is used to analyze and manipulate the structure of these graphs.\n    \n2.  Logic: Logical reasoning is used to make inferences about the relationships between entities in the RDF graph. Description Logic (DL) is a subset of First-order Logic (FOL) that is often used for this purpose.\n    \n3.  Probability and statistics: Plausible reasoning in AI systems often involve probability and statistics, as the agent must assign probabilities to different possible outcomes or explanations. Bayesian networks, Markov decision process and Gaussian Process are few examples that are used in this area.\n    \n4.  Machine learning: Machine learning techniques are used to train the AI system to make predictions or inferences based on the RDF data. This could be supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning depending on the problem at hand.\n    \n5.  Optimization: Optimization algorithms are used to find the best possible solution to a problem, given a set of constraints. Linear programming, convex optimization and other optimization techniques are used in AI systems.\n    \n6.  Natural Language Processing (NLP): Many semantic web applications involve natural language text, and NLP techniques are used to extract meaning from the text and relate it to entities in the RDF graph. This may include techniques such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis.\n    \n7.  Information retrieval: Information retrieval techniques are used to search and retrieve relevant information from the RDF graph. This may include techniques such as keyword-based search, semantic search, and graph-based search.\n    \n8.  Knowledge representation: Techniques such as ontologies and conceptual modeling are used to represent knowledge in a structured and formal way, making it easier for the AI system to understand and reason about the data.\n    \n9.  Distributed Systems: Some semantic web applications involve distributed data, and distributed systems techniques are used to manage and coordinate access to the data.\n    \n10.  Cyber Security: As with any system that handle sensitive data, security is of prime importance. Techniques from cryptography and secure protocols are used to secure the communication and storage of data.\n    \n\nIn summary, cognitive AI systems that work with semantic web technologies such as RDF and RDFS use a combination of mathematical techniques from various fields such as graph theory, logic, probability and statistics, machine learning, optimization, natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, distributed systems and cyber security to make inferences about the relationships between entities in the RDF graph and generate plausible explanations or solutions.\n\nCognitive AI systems that work with semantic web technologies such as RDF and RDFS use a combination of mathematical techniques from graph theory, logic, probability and statistics, machine learning and optimization to make inferences about the relationships between entities in the RDF graph and generate plausible explanations or solutions.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/PermissiveCommons/OpenDatav3.0PermissiveCommons/","title":"Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons\n\n_Why the open data movement needs a facelift, and how that might be done._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0HnyRBbZKPB_FVUvLAbNzQ.jpeg)\n\n**** ‘privacy vs. dignity’ and the nuances to be made between ‘open data’ and ‘permissive commons’ **** Image source: Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/IMissAustraliaGrewUpIn/](https://www.facebook.com/IMissAustraliaGrewUpIn/photos/a.227363927763383/650832355416536/?type=3&theater)\n\nThe open data movement is perhaps the most instrumental activity type, on the web, for the pursuit of humanitarian advancement.

Yet there are emergent problems, and opportunities — which brings about my considerations for how this instrumental movement might benefit from a facelift.\n\nTo distinguish between the two similar concepts, i introduce this concept of ‘permissive commons’.\n\nOpen data has been slowly uplifted to support software agents, as to support AI. These sorts of practices have been canvassed in an earlier post about [Tools that can help naturalise the web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) which in-turn relates also to my post about ‘[knowledge clouds](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9)’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dT5GV4fgqsuz_DH9KEnUDQ.png)\n\nPizza Ontology source: [Protege](https://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Protege4Pizzas10Minutes)\n\nIn someways, the considerations about ‘knowledge clouds’ could also be thought about in the form of knowledge trees & forests.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jJ-l1VhBiurHm7yZPHMNOg.jpeg)\n\n[Lod Cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/)\n\nTh Researchspace video below, illustrates these ‘knowledge clouds’ practice theory, in a manifest illustration of its meaningful utility for studies of history.\n\nThe difference between this ‘permissive commons’ approach and the research space illustration; is that permissive commons seeks to build these capacities into a _commons web,_ by using semantic web technologies in a particular way.\n\nThis distinct advantage brought about through the use of semantic web technologies and ecosystems; as apposed to other notation methods, is that works become both machine (AI) & human readable; and, if well designed, are able to be employ decentralised informatics outcomes, permissively.\n\nAnother way to visualise some components of how this works, can be visualised by testing out [mind-mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) software; whilst considering the opportunity to interlink maps or trees made in communities and other attributes such as temporal considerations are hard to see in a mind-map.\n\nA permissive commons approach is formed by defining Semantic ontologies.\n\n[Jason Silva: Shots of Awe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClYb9NpXnRemxYoWbcYANsA) — [What is Ontological Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aigR2UU4R20)?\n\nTherein; there is an important difference between the term [common](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/common) and [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons), in a similar way to the distinction between [civic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic) and [civics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civics), whilst both are important.\n\n> My work on Web Civics; is about fostering civilian participation WITH governments; rather than for government. Therein, “web civic” would be some sort of government owned thing, perhaps like a library, but web civics, is about fostering the importance role of civilians, citizens, to contribute. The idea being that practice of undertaking civics should be an inclusive practice with governments, the underlying context is that the role of citizens is important.\n\n> Without access to; and beneficial use of, knowledge, the means maintain [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood) and therefore the meaningful value of citizenship, is made mute.\n\nThe practice of commons or commoning as is distinct to ‘open’, considers the reality that most things (concepts, spaces, resources) are made permissively available to an intended group of people via means that incorporate custodial considerations to support the creation, governance and management of the common resources made to be part of a specified commons.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HQcbPdRHdXPMheX4b8Sf8w.png)\n\nIf we consider the role of ‘open data’ in association to the [DIKW Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid); then my explanation somewhat goes as follows,\n\n**Data** is bits of **information**, but not **information** itself. **Information** is in-essence, refined forms of data, made to be helpful to understand the some intended meaning.\n\nFake news, is information, but does not provide knowledge about the event or subject the fake news article talks about. **Knowledge** may be defined as relevant and objective **information** that helps in drawing conclusions (about the real world).\n\nThe purpose of improving upon the concept of ‘open data’ to ‘permissive commons’ in-effect seeks to forge a foundry for human activities to be put to the task of forging commons knowledge services that are able to be relied upon by other [agents](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent); ideally, in a ‘human centric’ approach, which would make other ‘artificial agents’ (software agents, company agents) servants of natural agents, and groups forged by natural agents as is made representative.\n\n> whilst noting the means to do so, would likely be best carried out using permissive commons, that in-turn provide support to form and maintain contracts online, and some existing work such as [creative commons](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_RDF), illustrates works in the field\n\n**Historical examples of commons**\n\nOlder (real-world) examples might make this easier to understand.\n\nFor example;\n\n**Farmers**\n\na group of farmers may cooperatively bring about the availability of a processing plant or storage facility for shared use as a commons facility. Yet this infrastructure is not intended to be entirely ‘free’, the facility has a governance framework and a group of intended beneficiaries,\n\nAs such, if some entrepreneur wanted to import competing resources to store in these facilities at the expense of farmers — that would not be allowed.\n\n**Yacht Club**\n\nSimilarly, a yacht-club might have a yard and a crane to help take a boat in and out of the water, and to make repairs; but it’s not able to be used to pull a motor out of vehicle or some other unintended purpose.\n\n> Therein — whilst many things are beneficially ‘commons’, their not “freely available to everyone to use and republish (or repurpose) as they wish”\n\nThe second issue is that of economic governance.\n\nWhilst many prefer the fantasy that things on the internet are truely free, this idea has no reliable foundation in reality. From the energy consumed to make computers work, to the resources invested in the manufacture of devices inter-networked on the web; and perhaps more importantly than most consider, the cost of life, as has been incurred by those who do some sort of work to foster growth both of the resources available on the web, and the means of online works to positively impact something that belongs to our biosphere, in some way (not always)…\n\n> Free, doesn’t actually exist. Without attribution, workers making things for ‘free’ are actually paying themselves to do something, without acknowledgement.\n\nWhilst this sort of framework has played a significant role for the creation of many good things; it is also instrumentally responsible for a great deal of bad and sometimes unintended outcomes.\n\nThe worst examples are those that show how this manifest well accepted practice of ‘web slavery’ has in-effect been weaponised as a cyber warfare tool.\n\nThereafter; Considerations of how ‘open data’ has been deployed shows that in reality there are actually very few known ‘_trusted_’ (whether trust-worthy or not) domain-name based sources (and underlying company structures) who are now the international gatekeepers to the [bewildering store of (human) knowledge](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/). This is in-turn considered to have some form of meaningful relationship between the relatively misleading concept defined as ‘open data’, and what may be improved upon as ‘permissive commons’, as to attach semantics relating to informatics and progress towards a knowledge age.\n\nWhereas; in todays ‘open data’ movement powering the ‘information age’,\n\n-   Whilst some websites aren’t very good due to a lack of available funding; and\n-   others continually make requests for donations; whilst a handful of others,\n-   act to support as beneficiaries; the largest corporations in the world.\n\n_The greatest beneficiaries of the well-intended and vitally important ‘open data movement’ is this handful companies, who positioned themselves as the communications and knowledge gatekeepers._\n\nHaving forged ‘golden handcuffs’ by owning the search-box, or a persons address book; these multi-billion dollar companies are now all too often associated with gainful incomes associated to nefarious actors and the ‘information’ they peddle for money that includes; fake news, spam and a great deal more. Making matters worse, the ontological vocabularies most used on the internet today refer to object definitions of well known words for specified purpose as to sell things.\n\nThe easiest way to example this, is how the system used by search giants; Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Yandex, etc. defines such things as a Physician.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BqPiHOLrtZjc256ClSu5gA.png)\n\n[https://schema.org/Physician](https://schema.org/Physician)\n\n[schemaorg](https://schema.org/) to populate search results and support the growth and development of AI, defines the term [Physician](https://schema.org/Physician) as a place, rather than person or profession.\n\n_Whilst it is understandably the case that the reason why this occurs is that the purpose of this vocabulary (which may be repurposed for many other applications, by trained or untrained producers) is to assist with discovering information on maps — the ability to find a doctors office._\n\nThe other relatively well characterised issue is that these systems now lack the ability to identify objects about the world, that have no financial incentive to illustrate. As is otherwise illustrated below; it is now easier to find a toilet by searching for the nearest McDonalds restaurant, due to the lack of ontology.\n\n> This predicament influences the manifest nature of how Artificial Intelligence Agents (software agents) are made to (be able to) work.\n\nIf we have an informatics environment that are **_centrally governed, on an international basis_** supporting ‘sense making’ capacities for all _things_; then the means to support ‘privacy’ or moreover dignity, is entirely undermined.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZrtG6-3JVLQMco58twkQtw.png)\n\n[Diagram i’ve authored previously about human centric web ecosystems](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infosphere_actor_objects.svg) | In relation to my blog post on webizen re: [SOCIO-ECONOMIC RELATIONS | A CONCEPTUAL MODEL](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/socioeconomic-relations-p1/)\n\n> As a consequence of my design considerations towards the manifestation of a [human centric web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4); one of the important functional requirement is the need to reliably obtain ‘commons’ informatics (data/information/knowledge) that can then be locally consumed in relation to the means for a machine-processed query (ie: AI function) to have the informatics-resources it needs available to it, to perform its basic functions, privately.\n\nThe alternative used today is generally provided as a domain based API, but this means the capacity to perform the query privacy is dependent upon them.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k0s8Efc1koWELEcEJpcbgA.jpeg)\n\nsource: reddit\n\nThe Open Data movement has brought about a somewhat exceptional ‘[open data charter](https://opendatacharter.net/)’ that provides a set of objective needs that are _of most importance_ for society via the lens of open data. My thoughts on permissive commons seek to uplift the spirit of these principles, as to support the manufacture of improved apparatus, as to put them to better use.\n\nWhilst it is ‘common sense’ that the principle of instrumental importance is the need to ensure read permissions (mostly) stay open; i’ll have to explain why i say ‘mostly’ and not always, in consideration of the fact that not-everyone needs to know everything; but this in-turn causes a ripple effect.\n\n**Introducing Permissive Commons: a technical architecture overview**\n\nBreaking down the parts, i’ll make some high-level notes about what i mean by permissive, and implicitly therein permissions; methods to support discoverability, decentralisation and custodianship. Whilst this methodology is designed to support the way systems work today; it’s also, and perhaps more importantly considering future needs, which i’ll briefly review also\n\n**1. Permissions to support permissive use.**\n\nPermissions from a perspective of technical apparatus; refers to the means for an agent to create, edit, read and append informatics resources or part of them. Commonly linked to the concept of [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (create, read, update, delete); permissioning systems offer a means to distinguish roles in relation to informatics resources. Another way of looking at permissions in a networked environment; is the idea of Attribute-based Access Control.\n\nIf this is considered in the context of systems that support version control, such as Git (as is distinct to Github); counterpart qualities brought about include; the ability to,\n\n-   To target a specific version by a specified publisher / authority\n-   ‘fork’ a version, update, make changes and re:publish as an alternate publisher / authority\n-   Curate versions between authorities as coupled or decoupled resources\n-   Reference related resources, for inferencing solutions, whilst retaining resolution of provenance and trust related semantic qualities.\n\nThis series of permission related considerations are important for supporting means to append, support versions and linked assets that are made to be connected to the original ‘piece’ of data that is not generically associated to ‘open data’ solutions today. A way this can be illustrated through the lens of documents; is in-turn, the subject of a life-long field of work by [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson).\n\nXanadu Space by Ted Nelson\n\nThe video by Ted illustrates the relationships between pieces of knowledge, fairly well. Yet therein, the way this is managed is through some form of authentication. The vast majority of web-use is now performed with the support of a few types of authentication, whilst the operational consumption of online material is not connected to a natural persons identity (at least not in a way that’s there for all to see).\n\n> Not everyone, needs to know everything\n\nIn the vast majority of use-cases, ‘Open’ read permissions are amongst the most important qualities that are required to uplift ‘open data’ intents; and any potential means to deliver better formats, as is the intent of this ‘permissive commons’ theory. Therein; the means to maintain the capacity to identify how an interaction with something has been influenced by others — becomes somewhat essential for ‘sense making’ with cyber-commons resources, that are intended to support cyber-physical systems.\n\n[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)\n\n> It is also important to consider the differentiated means for ‘sense making’ between those who do not have permission; and those who do. If a natural agent makes mistakes in reliance of the best available information they have available to them; this is very different to those how do the same, in a circumstance where it is clearly known to them, reality shows otherwise.\n\n> Considering the effect of this overtime; as is instrumentally known as learning, the knowledge of all things develops overtime; both individually, socially and globally, as may relate to the knowledge of all mankind.\n\nTherein; one might consider use-cases that relate to health and medicine.\n\nThe health-sciences field today, has a well-established ecosystem of available ontologies; yet present means for patients to play a better role is made hard.\n\n**Social Sciences & Medical Research**\n\nWithin the concept of permissive commons, is the consideration that some agents (actors) may not need the point-data, which is the exacting audit ready, otherwise ‘open’ record that relates to the useful embodiment of some sort of dataset, information asset / knowledge.\n\nIf researchers are doing work attempting to address a critical medico-legal / societal issue; such as suicide, there’s a bunch of informatics about a persons life (and the end of it), alongside useful informatics about relations to others socially surrounding a case; that if collected, collated and summarised, as to be provided as an anonymised dataset for researchers, could make it possible for outcomes to be found where it would be otherwise impossible to do so.\n\nBut the implications of these sorts of things associates directly to privacy; or moreover dignity considerations that may well affect children amongst others.\n\nTo ensure research is being carried out upon real data, and not made-up circumstances that may better suit aversions to inconvenient facts; the underlying data does in-fact need to have a means to be audited. An Audit function could be supported by a nominated authorised agent or agency, who could be equipped to support auditing services — much like an Accountant.\n\n_This process does not need to be public or made globally (or locally) centralised._\n\n> Meanwhile; large ‘data lakes’ (or knowledge banks) could aggregate informatics permissively from its customers as to generate anonymised summary results and insights; and/or, furnish means to act in a federated activity to perform specified queries across participant frameworks, privately; providing outputs as commons.\n\n> Similarly; specifically tailored agents could be produced to operate permissively with special interest groups; such as, people who suffer from a particular disease, ailment or health problem. Informatics could be curated for use by their medical clinicians, alongside derivative informatics products for researchers that are created by collating informatics via specified data-structures, from many people.\n\nIn other less sensitive areas of ‘open data’ policy; these types of practices are already readily used; Whether it be the availability of economic data or (almost) any other area of statistics, summaries are provided publicly; the underlying ‘point data’, not at all.\n\nYet a problem that today’s open-data movement hasn’t been able to resolve where it comes to analysis of social issues (for instance); is that the data collected can be from a relatively small study, as such the quality of the derivative materials become less reliable and is often also vexed with an array of other issues that relates to who did the study and for what purpose.\n\n**Cyber Knowledge Systems**\n\nThe issues that are exhibited in fields such as statistics or research; are both linked, yet seperate to those of how permissive commons may be used to help pizza shop owners sell pizzas they can make, on their own websites; or how, to produce accessibility to knowledge about our biosphere, flora, fauna and all sorts of things in it; alongside how to publish trusted information about where the local civic amenities are, as may be useful for people in the area.\n\nPermissions play a role in each case. The alternative of ‘open data’ from a lay perspective may be considered to suggest; that an agent can consume the open data provided by some authority, perhaps make changes to it to suit some form of agenda; and then republish it as an authoritative source.\n\n_It is not only troublesome in low-risk use-cases, but also dangerous in others._\n\nWithout the means to consume ‘knowledge’ or ‘information’, as does relate to a series of social frameworks relating to trust rationale, data is data, open or otherwise; ‘open data’ is far less useful than socio-cyber solutions that can be put to use to build trust-frameworks for commons and real-world tasks.\n\n**2. Authorities: Group Agents & write, edit & append permissions**\n\n**Agent Identifiers**\n\nThe ability to create a record is something that all persons should reasonably be made able to do; both as expressed persons (meaning — real-names used) and through means of psuedo-anonymity; which is to say, whilst not everyone needs to know everything. There are also attack vectors employed through the use of fake accounts, and this is also an important issue to address.\n\n> Bad actors sully the means for others to make use of resources to be enriched.\n\nCurrently, there’s an array of ways that agent identifiers are created; yet most of these methods now poorly support the means to maintain hygiene online.\n\nIn a great many use-case examples relating to commons, there have traditionally been nominated custodians or stewards.\n\nOne way i try to explain this is by considering the processes involved in the creation of a Church, Library, [Mechanics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics%27_Institutes) or University.\n\n_Stonemasons and such, would undertake the activity of building, the building._\n\nIt is most likely that they were paid for their labour to do so; but once their role in creating the civic infrastructure was done, the management of it was handed over to someone else.\n\n> Without a library, there would be no easy place to find or read a book; or in consideration of the concept more broadly; the means to learn, pray or live.\n\n> Those who made this infrastructure were not expected to extinguish their own lives for having done so; and, they were acknowledged for their works by some form made available for historical purposes if nothing else.\n\nIn consideration for how this associates to the concept of ‘write permissions’, the principle is that most forms of ‘commons’ has some form of custodianship framework. An example of the importance of this might be considered in relation to the use-case of making the discovery of public toilets available online where it is preferable that a means to ensure results are properly qualified.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BPC7fRRADXgVrRiKdscdyg.png)\n\nSearch result Aug 2016 for ‘public toilet’\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1JTVStIhYqjv_2bjDKmfhg.jpeg)\n\nThe Public Toilets example is similar in nature to that of the needs for programs such as [Neighborhood Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_watch), a community program that seeks to provide a social means to help people who need to find a safe place to go.\n\nIn both cases, it is important that the resources found online have the backing of a community based custodial to ensure safety for those who use the facility.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ct6vUfVrYeR375k0tKjmvA.png)\n\n[Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)\n\nWhat we developed in W3C Credentials CG was a set of tools that could be used to verify how one particular agent, such as a trusted institution, was able to make a set of statements that could in-turn be consumed by others as a series of trustworthy informatics resources; as required to support trustworthy, decision makers.\n\nTherein; the consideration of ‘permissive commons’ as distinct to ‘open data’, seeks to attend to the underlying reality that the way ‘commons’ are managed and made discoverable; does indeed relate to, a complex web of permissions that whilst indirectly considered in the somewhat misleading concept of ‘open data’; does in-fact relate to a set of supportively permissive practices. By refining the declarations of how this is (better) achieved, commons becomes more usefully available; and participatory engagement is in-turn encouraged.\n\n**3. Format**\n\n**3.1 Linked Data & URIs**\n\nThe practice method for publishing Permissive commons is best done by rendering resources in linked-data RDF related formats; with or without the use of DID based URIs.\n\nWhat are DID’s?\n\n[DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) technology is poorly documented as a consequence of intentional decision making practices brought about whilst the work was getting (funded) done. In-essence, the documentation today speaks of identity; whereas DIDs are also useful for supporting identified, entities; whereby (machine readable) statements are made with the use of cryptographic instruments.\n\n{  \n  \"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2019/did/v1\", \"https://w3id.org/security/v1\"],  \n  \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",  \n  ...  \n  \"publicKey\": [{  \n    \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1\",  \n    \"type\": \"RsaVerificationKey2018\",  \n    \"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",  \n    \"publicKeyPem\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\\r\\n\"  \n  }, {  \n    \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2\",  \n    \"type\": \"Ed25519VerificationKey2018\",  \n    \"controller\": \"did:example:pqrstuvwxyz0987654321\",  \n    \"publicKeyBase58\": \"H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV\"  \n  }, {  \n    \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-3\",  \n    \"type\": \"Secp256k1VerificationKey2018\",  \n    \"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",  \n    \"publicKeyHex\": \"02b97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71\"  \n  }],  \n  ...  \n}\n\n> note comments made in: [Comms & Security: privacy vs. dignity](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0) and The article ‘[tools that can help naturalise the web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3)’ goes into the mechanics of how this works in more detail.\n\nPart of the underlying requirements is to ensure resources are made available in a format that is addressable via a URI. DID’s provide a means to decentralise the custodianship of a URI as to decouple the authoritative source(s) from a traditional approach that would require a HTTP based URI.\n\n**3.2 Made for Decentralised use**\n\nThere are an array of DLT solutions that are becoming available (post blockchain, blockchain related tech) that include DHT methods amongst the many. Early W3C CG works uplifted MIT [HTTPA](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2010/Papers/IAB-privacy/httpa.pdf) works with [WebDHT](https://opencreds.org/specs/source/webdht/), whilst later works evolved to consider [WebLedger](https://w3c.github.io/web-ledger/) solutions. Whilst it is envisaged that standards will emerge in this particular area of protocol innovation; the underlying principle is that the storage framework should be able to support decentralised and therefore local use.\n\nThe easy explanation for lay people, is that it works kinda like a blockchain or torrent; in that, an announcer provides discovery for the information that is made downloadable, as to be able to make use of it locally.\n\nAmongst the best illustrations of solutions that have been made to work currently, is that which has been produced by the internet archive; called [dweb](https://dweb.archive.org/) ([source](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-archive)). dWeb implements the internet archive using [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) and [wolk](https://wolk.com/); whilst [gun.eco](https://gun.eco/) (a graphDB) and the [holochain protocol](https://holochain.org/) (as distinct to holo, the company, or commons engine as a holo related initiative) are amongst the notable protocol solutions DID technology tries to harmonise. I am not aware of any ‘standard’ (IETF presumably) protocol solution; although the topic has been explored for sometime via the [IRTF Information Centric Networking](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/icnrg/about/) research group (IRTF is associated to IETF); and some components of the required solutions have been made IETF RFCs as a consequence of community group works facilitated by way of W3C-CGs.\n\nImportantly; the solutions that will work, need to support RDF or moreover; the principles underpinning semantic web ecosystems. Whilst DID documentation is in my mind, poorly produced; the solutions framework is intended to support otherwise not-updated semantic web documentation that moreover expressly refers to services provided solely, over HTTP.\n\n**3.3 Support for Version Control (Provenance & History)**\n\nThere are many use-cases where the versions of; and temporal notations of, a resource becomes important for the means and derivative insights brought about by its use.\n\nAs such; The considerations have a set of real-world implications in relation to law, but also many other things and practicalities.\n\nWhilst the continual improvement of knowledge is most certainly desirable, or moreover a ‘must have’, in terms of technical functional qualities; as it is likely to be the case that erroneous decisions may be made on the basis of false, misleading or bad data; the answer to this problem isn’t simply the means for the issue to be scrubbed from history (as to form a dissociative relationship to any implications). Relations naturally change overtime, intrinsically forming a form of temporal ontologically discernible quality, that by simply updating a singular record in a manner that makes the formerly relied upon version entirely unavailable, cannot support.\n\n> One reason why it is important, is that changes to URI sourced materials may in-fact substantially change its meaning, as may in-turn act to pervert sense making.\n\n> People have the right to change their minds; their position, on any given topic… Indeed moreover it’s expected of people who are considered to be reason-able.\n\nThe practice of learning implicitly relates & relies upon the capacities of a system, to support the notion of evolution of understandings, as to support the concept of understanding, as is employed improve upon prior _temporal_ states. In socially-applied informatics environments, the provenance of inter-related ‘ripple effects’ is of importance to relations denoted as observations (or ‘observers’) of other agents, who have at some time interacted with it.\n\n**4. Societal Custodial relations & Stewardship**\n\n(Data|Information | Knowledge) ‘Commons’ are essential tools to support means through which natural agents are made able to engender their own sense of wisdom, that may only then, become in-turn, a shared resource.\n\nIn the Natural world; this is often articulated via identified groups, such as is the case with a nations system of government. Therein; the articulation of laws in societies have a material and custodial relationship to Acts of Parliament; and thereafter, relationships to any judgements and common-law. Permissive commons as a cyber-physical toolset in-turn supports the means to extend the acts of real-world natural agents to support (and influnce) analysis practices. One example of this is that some of the permissive commons assets available, might be done to associate two otherwise foreign uses of similar terms, with some sense of discernible logic (ideally both machine and human readable, as may be achieved per point 3) as to support the means for others to comprehend such things as the differences between ‘copyright’ in one region, to the definition formed by laws in Another.\n\nAs such, one might imagine a time where the votes made by parliamentarians (and any notes that may relate to their vote) could be made in a digitally ‘minted’ format, that in-turn acts digitally to be a signatory to the introduction of that commons asset; and/or, the renewal of it. Yet also, thereafter, others may then in-turn form meaningful relations and inferences between those laws and considerations that are not necessarily ‘same as’ but ‘similar to’ others elsewhere; and in-turn, providing semantics explaining how & why.\n\nWhere the consideration relates, in-turn, to the practices of managing civic amenities; in countries such as Australia, it is the role of local government, otherwise known as councils or shires; whom by means of the Australian Constitution act as agents of state government to support the maintenance of these assets by way of tasks performed by employees of the local authority.\n\nMembers of the public are expressly invited to contribute or notify their local council if there is a problem; but, the ‘digital twin’ of the physical asset online, would be a permissive commons assets that is governed by the local council, and would most likely be governed through an integration with council systems, as to trigger updated information.\n\n> _An example may be that of vandalism, or closure for some reason._\n\n> But the manner in how these informatics objects that are ‘commons’ are managed; is reasonably considered to need an authority. The availability of the afore mentioned, toilets, or safe spaces — need authorities involved for safety.\n\nAnother example may be the rules that are set-out and publicly available for Augmented Reality Applications; to ensure virtual game objectives are not encouraging children to play on roads or freeways; or conversely, that perhaps ‘virtual boundaries’ are able to be set-around safe areas like parks, for AR Play.\n\nI envisage the means to create various constructs of ‘knowledge forests’ that interweave the voices of citizens, electronically; as resources for stewards to employ & be made accountable; as would relate to their roles of managing permissive commons. Semantic Web provides the sense-making linkages between informatics resources; DIDs help decentralise discovery and use, version control and permission systems help form trustworthy Semantics.\n\nTherein; the authoritative chains are not, by design, intended to be globally centralised in any practical way; rather, the employment of standards and emergent protocols enable the creation of societal systems to extend support for cyber-physical relations to conform to real-world [fiduciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary) relationships.\n\n**5. Artificial Intelligence**\n\nHBO Silicon Valley ‘not hotdog’\n\nPerhaps of most importance today, is the array of considerations brought about by the instrumental use of ‘data’ for software agents, or AI. The means to ensure the role & responsibility of parliamentarians, amongst others, has never before become so important, as is now the case, as required, to uplift the purposeful role of humanitarian tenure in any role; in an age where artificial intelligence systems are going to be of enormous influence.\n\n> The same consideration is made for all members of our human family; yet, it seems pointless if those consider themselves most importance as societal leaders, fail to understand how ‘taking the easy road’ may now poorly affect others in a way that is not the same as any human based systems framework, worked before.\n\n_I state it to be the case, clearly; that our information systems today do not support anonymity. As such; they are not able to fully support entirely private use. Indeed also, this principle is reasonably cemented in natural laws, as may be examined using science; in manners now significantly enhanced with social graph technology as to explore relationships between the means to discern inferences, and the effects of actions as is examined as formative interference patterns that have a direct and inferred relationship to causality._\n\nThe question that is brought about; is whether and how to make best use of the opportunity, to make something that supports the distribution and curation of knowledge apparatus, accessibility, and how it is to be managed.\n\nHow can we employ ICT strategies, to in-turn promote capacity that enriches usefully evolved bodies of knowledge, as to best support the notion of mandate; and, how can resources used, be considered trustworthy, by courts.\n\nSystems are reliant upon agreements internationally, how should permissive commons be made to work; for the betterment of all stakeholders involved.\n\nThe informatics systems that are being defined on way or another (but not necessarily as commons) is not solely about text or numeric data; but also, informatics structures that are used to discern aspects of reality in many ways.\n\nOne such way is rich-media, where the EU funded [Mico Project](http://mico-project.eu) made headway to standardise tools that could lead to services that could democratise the use of AI, for the analysis of rich media assets. The perceived value of this emergent field was illustrated by the US TV Show [Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/).\n\n> [See Mike Judge, co-creator of the HBO series Silicon Valley speak at the Decentralised Web Summit, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-5HXDOveGM).\n\nOne of the stories in this show illustrates a narrative about a computer vision tool that is first funded as a tool to identify food.\n\nHBO: Silicon Valley Season 4 Episode 4 ‘Seefood Technologies and ‘Not Hot Dog’\n\nWhat this illustrates; is that, no-matter whether or not any choices are made, the vast global silo’d infrastructure that is moreover converged into the community of california (and Californian law) have enormous data capabilities to see what is actually going on. These tools are applied to media online, and the derivative services made available via a proprietary API.\n\n> This does not best support the democratisation of AI\n\nThe decisions that can be made, in a business systems based vacuum. The alternative of ‘permissioned commons’ could limit and lesson means through which people are harmed; whether wilfully, negligently or due to practices of malfeasance; the factors that need to be addressed as to best respond to the issues brought about by ‘AI’ include factors or circumstances; that will otherwise lead to poor or false belief’s & statements. This pervasive problem is likely to in-turn influence public records, including those such as the [hansard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansard). So, there’s a question about the relationships between matters of fact, as are able to be assessed by someone due to the ever growing surveillance capabilities consumed as a raw resource, for AI. Importantly therein also, the availability of business systems to support work being done.\n\n> One way to address this problem is to form a [Micropayments Standards: An Economic Imperative for the Knowledge Age](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b), noting the practice of doing so is in-effect the same as the tactical process required for permissive commons.\n\nAI capabilities are usefully able to be employed; as to discern or make distinct, the means or comprehension, to distinguish between actors who are known to have known what; in relation to the commission of wrongdoings. This helps to discern intent in relation to a wrongful act, but only if it’s a supported function. To do so, my belief is in a knowledge banking industry, yet today this seems most likely to occur as a consequence of new projects by facebook or similar. Whilst the [Libra Association](https://libra.org/en-US/association/) couples the existing capacity of those such as facebook to update and improve upon its global graph; a globally democratised alternative, would require much more work to evolve.\n\nYet the principle capacity to discern the difference between someone who knew better, and those who were reasonably not able to know, critical and instrumental pieces of information; is able to be demonstrated by those such as facebook (and google), today. In relation to the use of these sorts of systems by AI agents, it is not simply about the means to understand what is known; but also what is not. Permissive commons is instrumental to forming a non-corporatised approach, to how this is facilitated for our natural world.\n\n**_Finally — AI & Intellectual property._**\n\nIn the show, Silicon Valley, it is later found that the ‘seefood technologies’ not hot dog app; is unable to identify any other food than hotdogs. It is then found to be best able to be repurposed for commercial purposes, to identify explicit materials online.\n\nHBO Silicon Valley ‘not hot dog’ app repurposed\n\nInternational trade is built upon the works of others that become protected by law by terms relating to Intellectual property. Whilst there could be a system that paid a nominal amount, such as $0.00001 every time something useful; is made use of, this capacity doesn’t exist in business systems online today.\n\n> The consequence is competition between subject matter experts, rather than being able to forge cooperative alliances working collaboratively towards the realisation of specified goals. Consequentially, we consume more energy, to form progress…\n\nPerhaps as a defensive tactic, there is a call [to recognize AI as an inventor.](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49191645)\n\n> I think more simply put, if you had a global company that was able to read and collate all the documents produced about innovative and potentially valuable ideas from all across the world; would you make a bot that directed key staff, partners and alliances towards an augmented & AI Curated experience that may help them get a patent on those ideas first?\n\nWould it be consistent with the principles of good corporate citizenship, to let foreigners have the opportunity to get those economic opportunities in place first? In the current ecosystems, unlike [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty), the answer is reasonably, no.\n\nGovernments could set-out a set of principles for Cyberspace, but today that doesn’t exist. I have registered ‘thecharter.eco’ but its an idea not a useful tool.\n\n> As part of a ‘permissive commons’ approach, it is entirely possible to deliver a set of ontological resources that consider our ecosphere and the impact cyber-physical systems have on all things real, as are part of our natural world.\n\n> I am interested in exploring this idea; and i hope others will be too…\n\n**6. Democracy, Citizenship & the role of Web Worker Rights**\n\nIn-order to make permissive commons work to best effect; the concept would require an international network of domestic systems of inter-governance.\n\nShould present infrastructure be better ‘democratised’, then the outcome could not only be the creation of ‘more jobs’; but also — improved means for the governance of nation built upon a system of democracy that grew from such concepts as ‘rule of law’.\n\nIn our internationally competitive environment, we have not yet applied considerations of how project frameworks like [BOT/DBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer), or public-private partnerships, used to build the libraries of the past; could be used to address our means to attend to the importance of critical, cyber-social infrastructure, as is required by mankind. In my opinion, it would be enormously short-sighted, no-matter the difficulties involved in garnishing an effective basis for informed decision making, to not do so, as can be made, to be brought about.\n\n> The competition is not between the aristocrats and ‘old money’ tribes whose castles of wealth at times form adversarial interests to the common citizen;\n\n> Rather, this competition is arguably about the relevance of a nations government at all. Without domestic means to support sense making and therein mandate, cyber-physical systems threaten reemergence of old problems via cyber domains.\n\nThe competitive forces are international in nature, not local. In terms of trade, having the truth called out in secret overseas, is much worse than the cost of addressing the underlying issues on a domestic basis.\n\nThe implications to how why it is important to attend to these issues should be reasonably universally understood; as to positively impact the lives of children EVEN THOUGH, their family members may have a position of importance, publicly. This nature of ‘permissive commons’ gets to the heart of how it is we can meaningfully and purposefully produce tools, to support human dignity.\n\n_The most awesome way i’ve seen this explained; is this short video,_\n\nnew definition of a billionaire, “to positively impact the lives of a billion people”\n\n_Therein,_ [_Jason Silva_](https://www.thisisjasonsilva.com/) _ends his parable with the concept that the future definition of a billionaire, is a person who has positively impacted the lives of a billion people. With permissive commons, this is made far easier to achieve._\n\nPermissive commons is an instrumental part of how we may best create a modern innovative medium, for the [_bewildering store of knowledge_](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) that has been fostered as to become useful real-world knowledge assets, by mankind.\n\nThe way this can be funded, is through the meaningful use of micropayments, yet the implication of bringing about a means to pay people who do valuable work in areas that support the evolution of our shared commons, leads to a situation where we need to think about anti-money laundering laws, or KYCC/AML.\n\n> When associating reasonably tiny fractions of a cent that contributes towards a persons means to be paid a wage; until a reasonable amount has been garnished by that contributor (ie: ~$xx per hour), then the means to form a practice method where mankind is encouraged to invest in works for the betterment of our world; rather than alternatives such as fake news, [which are known to be of far more value to creators today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news_website#North_Macedonia).\n\n-   The ability to make use of the internet, is not truely free today.\n-   Civilians, are now considered in terms of their role as a [consumer to be protected](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/CompetitionLaw/UN-Guidelines-on-Consumer-Protection.aspx); rather than as natural world tenants, companies _should_ serve..\n\nThe manifest converse reality is; that today, it’s their attention that’s being consumed as a resource, and that ‘open data’ frameworks have contributed to the drivers that now propagate many distinct fiction of reality; which are in-turn beneficially, complimentary to old ‘resource based economy’ method; pervasively employed to consume all natural resources, for (false) profits.\n\nAs a supplemental to the video above, Author [Shoshana Zuboff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff) in the video Age of Surveillance Capitalism: “We Thought We Were Searching Google, But Google Was Searching Us” illustrates her position on how the web works today.\n\nWhilst the underlying purported concept of ‘consumer’ doesn’t really apply, as the global platforms that are related to this concept don’t really have competitors, so as there’s no ‘choice’, its not really about market alternatives.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SOaVuHVuheFjVMcYu6f4-w.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/)\n\n> If someone asks you to connect with them on facebook, you have to use facebook. If you leave facebook, you can’t take your ‘friends’ with you.\n\nSo, the concept of being a ‘consumer’ is not fit or proper, for many reasons.\n\n-   The customers of these sites are those who pay to display advertising. Therein, the first component of ‘costs’ relates to their income streams.\n-   People need to pay for the connectivity. In telecommunications terms this relates to a metric called ‘Average Revenue Per User’ or ARPU.\n-   People need to pay to buy the consumer electronics that are used to participate in society in a way that demands ownership of these tools; and,\n-   People are increasingly paying a significant additional fee to international companies who are providing valued services.\n\n_On top of all of that is the cost of living. So, energy, housing, food, health, etc._\n\n> These costs could be reduced to a average number, per hour which is like to be in dollars ($x/h), tens of dollars or perhaps hundreds or thousands of dollars when associated to wealthier people or legal personalities (companies).\n\n> Part of these costs could also consider consequential costs of false assumptions and the insurable benefits of improving the basis upon which decisions are made.\n\nAnother consideration worth thinking about, is the underlying nature of economics and how it is actually made to work. The purpose of money is exchange. So that people who work to do things that are of social value are able to exchange ‘goods and services’ with others.\n\nIf a vast group of **work** types are considered to be ‘free’, this damages society.\n\nI am in no way suggesting that someone should be able to make unfair requests; indeed quite the opposite, but there is a balance to be forged.\n\nTherein; in seeking to align the above considerations with the concept of permissive commons, it must be noted that the world as we know it wouldn’t have been made able to work; as we now benefit from, if the information we knew and had available to us freely; such as language, and the means to discover places and place names; was subject to economic gatekeepers by a few knowable entities who governed those ‘knowledge assets’ world-wide.\n\n> Permissive commons, is about forming a cyber-physical solution to support the continuance of those underlying principles as are required for mankind.\n\nIt is reasonable to consider that the work of someone to do stuff that’s good for humanity, is something that should be supported.\n\nTherein, as an example; if someone fixes a bug in software that may expose IoT infrastructure to exploitation, their ‘fix’ might positively impact billions of devices; and only take, a relatively short time to achieve (ie: hours, days or weeks).\n\n> Say, it is their profession to do these sorts of things; and that, it’s how they support their families and their means to learn and maintain their skills.\n\n_As such, they calculate their cost per hour to be about $500 for this sort of work, so if their work is found to fix a problem and took 20 hours, then that’s a cost of about $10,000._\n\nIf the means to articulate this cost to its use on a billion devices, its not much at all per unit that’s attributed in-order for them to get paid for that work. Therein, the consideration is that as a consequence of the use of time which both supports contribution in addition to consumption; the opportunity to add to calculations basic levels of support for human activity, isn’t a bad thing.\n\n> To do so, would require standards and infrastructure solutions not present today.\n\n_The additional benefit is that if they’ve built in an exploit, then they’re also able to be made accountable for doing so, if it’s been done intentionally._\n\n> This is the sort of opportunity that’s brought about with permissive commons in a way that could be explored further; and its important government plays a role.\n\nThis is not to say that governments should be the sole provider, but rather regulatory frameworks play an important role. This concept ‘permissive commons’ seeks to ‘do away’ with survelliance capitalism in many useful ICT applications; and seeks to better articulates the concept now known as ‘open data’; as to better align what seems to be the underlying intent, with our modern needs, in our modern age; which in-turn, i suggest, needs a re:think.\n\n**IN SUMMARY: JOBS AND PERMISSIVE COMMONS**\n\nToday, there are no shortage of jobs to do, there’s a set of artificial boundaries that have been placed upon the means to pay anything for useful work. The consequence of this policy is that people who want to do good things for society and ‘stuff’ that positively impacts our biosphere; are now often paid far less, than those who knowingly do the opposite, this impacts societal value(s).\n\nAs to assist with considerations i’ve drafted some thought, that i’ve titled ‘[Engineering Einstein](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/engineering-einstein-cab894659c02)’ whilst the underlying hope, is that we’d reinvent the kindness equastion at a time when its well known our biosphere, needs help.\n\nThe means to attribute ‘good work’ with income, needs to be addressed as part of the social factors that relate to how it is commons are produced and maintained. Much like the stonemasons building libraries, it didn’t mean they were paid, forever, every time someone sought to use the commons facility.\n\nThere are an array of distinct and differentiated business systems opportunities that can come about; if we have a little more faith, in humanity.\n\n> Conversely;\n\n> Without the means to articulate the spirit of humanitarian principles, as are in-turn rendered meaningful support by systems of governance; our means, as citizens, to get on with the job of cooperatively attending to issues, becomes unduly hampered.\n\nIf we build a ‘knowledge layer’ of permissive commons to the web, then not only are we made better equipped to build upon the knowledge artifacts distributed by others; but we are also better equipped to qualify what it is we’re most capable as knowledge agents, to render as services for others. The permissive commons frameworks, as does uplift open data, lod-cloud and similarly available systems today; enables a person to analyse themselves, or be permissively analysed by others, in relation to ‘known — knowledge’, to articulate accomplishment, capability and other semantic nuances attributable to a natural agent as are factors relating to trust. These systems are not intended to be ‘open’ but rather permissive, and requires permissive commons in-order to be made to work.\n\nAn alternative is facebook, but we can address these sorts of issues, and it starts with the production of tooling that is made to relied upon for an [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere) of permissive commons; and the way that may be used throughout our world. Whether or not these sorts of systems exist isn’t really a relevant, as it is most likely the case that even if we don’t do that, the engineered future of how things are made to work, will causally impacts us all using informatics.\n\nWe can choose to make sense-making a commercial asset, or define a system that is made to work that employs a set of principles i call ‘permissive commons’. One alternative is better for greed, the other for our biosphere."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/PermissiveCommons/TechforPermissiveCommons/","title":"Tech for Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Tech for Permissive Commons\n\n### How is a ‘permissive commons’ system made to work, and what does it provide, technically?\n\n**Background**\n\nI have previously written a less-technical article on [permissive commons that can be found here](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e). This is part of an overall [ecosystems approach that is intended to forge a ‘human centric’ informatics environment](https://medium.com/webcivics/).\n\nThe difference between traditional ‘silo’d’ approaches and this ‘human centric’ approach is in the provision of safe & secure informatics environments, where the data collected about people and in relation to people; is stored on behalf of those people.\n\nThis methodology is an alternative to the already well developed ‘[_persona ficta_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)’ centric alternatives where information is stored in relation to web-services operated by a website provider in the more traditional sense..\n\nTo achieve an outcome where people can beneficially ‘bank’ their own data and operate its use with applications, systems need to use decentralisation methods in a different way to how it is generally done already.\n\n> Existing sites (like facebook, youtube, google, etc.) are distributed across a multitude of servers across the world as to make their websites work, their decentralised systems still centralise authentication, database management and commercial / legal business systems.\n\nIn the alternative method that is sought to be achieved by a human centric web methodology; these business functions become technically decentralised as to bring to effect a means where the extension of agency (ie: personal agency) becomes inclusive to both data, and the repercussive informatics events that are derived as a consequence of personal expressions of thought.\n\n> To achieve this outcome, a different set of tooling is required.\n\nWhilst these alternative systems are designed to support all forms of legal actors (and their tools); the consequential technical design element that is sought to be achieved by way of Permissive Commons, relates to the functional requirements of seeking to obtain knowledge about the world in the form of structured data and to make use of that within private settings.\n\nIt is difficult to find images that describe how this can be made to work within a [knowledge bank](https://medium.com/p/164e19242b99) that supports [inforgs](https://medium.com/webcivics/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4). Nonetheless, there are many examples of how this sort of technical infrastructure is used in conventional web-based business model backed web-services.\n\n### To better support evaluation; I’ll use healthcare informatics as an example. .\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nnPi4Gg5UOnQQLOyVct_Tg.png)\n\nSource: [**A survey of current trends in computational drug repositioning**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274389217_A_survey_of_current_trends_in_computational_drug_repositioning)\n\n**Computational Repositioning strategies** represents a series of data-sources and related libraries of information, all of which could be different forms of permissive commons.\n\nTherein, societal knowledge that has been produced in many ways, is able to be communicated in a common ‘linked data’ format (or transformed to linked-data, whilst many [health-sci systems are in LinkedData and often ‘Open’](https://lod-cloud.net/)).\n\nNow for a moment, imagine you’ve got a place to store all the information that relates to your health. Perhaps there is an extraordinary change, and the safest places for personal information are provided by Google, Apple, Facebook and similar. Or perhaps, there’s a knowledge bank that kinda needs, permissive commons (as i continue to explain how, and why).\n\nSo, the above image illustrates how there’s a bunch of scientific knowledge about the world, but in-order to make use of it personally generated information, or information generated about a person, needs to be processed in relation to available knowledge in the world to the articulated ‘senses’ transcribed to data, by way of — what i’d call, an inforg. For purposes relating to health; this could include,\n\nSocial factors, both those relating to the spread of disease and those relating to behaviours where [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) could be used to process communications to see if you are happy or sad, and if there’s trends at different times of the day.\n\nThere could be dietary considerations, that could review not simply the information about the objects that have been consumed, but also the [entire history of the ingredients](https://github.com/ouisharelabs/food-dashboard) relating to the production and distribution of those food and beverage objects and information about the make-up of those food-stuffs.\n\n> It might also form relational links, so if a few people who ate at one restaurant all get sick at a similar time, this can form part of the inferencing capacities.\n\nInformation about exercise, sleep cycles alongside other biosensors & ‘smart things’ like ‘smart toilets’ producing health-data alongside the information created about persons every time the person gets a medical check, test, image or procedure.\n\nThe analytics information that helps cameras identify who you are, such as your walking gait could be stored as to analyse for changes that may denote a health problem emerging.\n\nWhat is Ontological Design?\n\nAll of this information needs to be stored in a structured format that is able to be understood by the software processes and systems made able to use it. The term used to define these vocabularies is ontology, which provides electronic record data-structures, that are able to be produced using multiple ontologies.\n\n> Traditional approaches brings all of this data into the same ‘silo’ as the provider, but their design practices, relating to why they do so, isn’t necessarily about you.\n\nAnther problem is, that due to real-world issues that do reasonably relate to personal agency and trust; these systems are often incomplete. Considerations such as whether an intimate partner is being intimate with others, and how that may have social-health effects, isn’t part of it. The implications of loosing a job and financial distress, not part of it. The information about whether there is a known environmentally toxic event, not part of it. Not-only do these practical health impacting circumstances, the problem develops a situation where solutions either seek to obtain all the information they can possibly get as to improve the way their AI systems work; or, end-up being /less unreliable.\n\nSo, the underlying purpose of decentralising ‘[open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data)’ (note ‘[principles](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/)’) in a manner that supports the needs of institutional (and other) producers of to employ and rely upon reformulated ‘_permissive commons_’ informatics products; is about providing the means for their tools to be used by persons in a particular way; that seeks to better support privacy, or moreover, human dignity (and therein, confidentiality).\n\n> If couples form agreements about how their relationship works, that’s fine — but it’s not something that needs to be published on facebook. If there are relationship problems that relate to clinically relevant considerations, how could it be dignified to be treated for something else entirely? If information about you and your relationships in the form of your ‘digital twins’ is being used to define you, wouldn’t you want to define in that environment how you treat others with dignity? or is it suggested, that these sorts of consideration, really don’t matter…\n\n[Semantic Web technologies](https://medium.com/webcivics/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) are not only used today, but are about the only global ‘patent pool protected’ royalty free method able to power advanced AI.\n\nWhilst health is amongst the highest, of high-stakes use-cases, the principle methodology sought to be employed to produce a human centric web is intended to result in an outcome that is considered ‘safe, for health’.\n\nPermissive commons is intended to provide the means for institutional providers, who have huge server-farm capabilities (something a home-server just can’t do on its own) to get a functional local copy of information from sources across the world; and to then, empower human beings to make use of it without having to necessarily share how they’ve used it or what it says, to anyone unless they’ve defined how they want it to be used for the benefit of others. The only two fragmented elements are that;\n\nA. If anonymised statistical data can be collected and aggregated from a multitude of ‘knowledge banks’ this would be good for research & STEM.\n\nB. Circumstances whereby law provides the capacity to seek specific info.\n\nMore broadly; as to recenter the article away from the specificities of health,\n\nThe permissive commons framework in-turn considers also derivative considerations relating to other articles and resources that consider the need to have [a micropayments standards](https://medium.com/webcivics/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b) alongside the work supported by [Amanda Jansen](https://medium.com/u/34a278c5b33a) on [value accounting initiatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UK9eWFjQRbGtF7wAMBNyntT7kZNpvSIe5cSY_VAuE0Q/edit?ts=5c9aec18); and those of her (/our) works on [assessing the qualities of existing DLT solutions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZHjCnQZRUC6Dkqv2yA4H9Djd5Sf6z04-SfyquIV0YI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n> These works are in-turn was produced to both to support this scope of works; alongside the means to evaluate biosphere impacts (ie: energy consumption) alongside other attributes that are envisaged to inform the rationale as to why open standards are required.\n\nSo; to recap,\n\nDynamic (semantic) Agents are a form of software agent that makes use of ‘AI’ tools that make use of available data in association to queries, and the rules set-out by someone that defines how the request for information should respond.\n\n> The practice method sought by a human centric approach centres upon the means for a natural person to make use of a dynamic agent (ai) for personal use; without being unnecessarily (or so it may be considered due to the advent of a solution) interference by international or corporate desires being injected into the ‘sense making’ methodologies of dynamic agents; and the effects this has on both natural agents, and broader socio-economic systems upon both man-made and biosphere environments.\n\n_A key element to how this is thought to be best made to work; is through this concept of ‘_[_permissive commons_](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)_’ and as the intention of this article; is to illustrate some of the more technical details…._\n\nThe most basic explanation is: that the informatics assets required for ‘freedom of though’ need to be distributed across the web as a core component of how it is that our cyber environment is made to work.\n\n**TECHNICAL INTRODUCTIONS**\n\nThe concept of permissive commons is built upon the idea of [information centric networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking) approach, that is similar to many DLT solutions in many ways. One technical difference, is that i’m suggesting a standard be produced which is seemingly the domain of IETF.\n\nPermissive commons infrastructure could thereafter, incorporate economic considerations that seek to fund the availability of this ‘content’ or ‘information’ centric networking approach. The rationale being that the core libraries required for enterprise systems as part of the functional requirements for distributing trusted copies of datasets; share similar technical properties to the requirements that exist to support micropayments.\n\n> Additionally, the means to provide a means to attribute ‘work’ with fair-payments for workers, alongside attribution, would improve support for international law as may in-turn act to support improved qualities relating to trust dependencies.\n\nThe objective, should a protocol be defined as a standards, would be to deliver an opportunity ‘_better than bitcoin_’, that acts in-turn, to support kindness, human creativity & STEM in knowledge based activities, alongside economics.\n\n### **Functional Requirements**\n\n**Linked Data**\n\nThe methodology MUST support linked-data URIs. This may include [DIDs](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/did) or alternative IANA assigned URI-Schema that would support a similar function.\n\n**Version Control**\n\nThe methodology MUST provide the ability to reference the temporal attribution (version) in addition to the identifier list object (‘most recent’ URI) and provide the means to support inferencing mapping should variations between the two exist.\n\n> When actors in a social system are generating data overtime, these events are temporally associated. URIs that refer to resources that are not temporally notated bring about a problem where the definition of that resource can be changed overtime; which in-turn has the effect of changing the semantics\n\n**Decentralised**\n\nThe methodology MUST support the ability to obtain for local use a copy of the informatics datafile for private use in relation to semantic inferencing services; and related functional requirements.\n\n**Permissive**\n\nThe methodology MUST support an array of permissive modalities that range from a single custodian signature to that of a permissive group; inclusive of workflow considerations (roles: ie: draft, unofficial, official, etc.).\n\nPermissions should include considerations about read, write, append, bi-Directional Links, etc.\n\n> In many use-cases networked informatics resources need to maintain persistence and shouldn’t be deleted, and is noted in relation to the concept of [CoolURIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/) by [TimBL](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) that is summarised as ‘cool uris do not change’\n\n**Multiplicity: The means to define a multitude or _plurality_ of ledgers, with a multiplicity of permissive orientations as to produce ‘fit for purpose’ informatics resources.**\n\nIn-order to support an array of functional considerations, the suggested method would produce a multitude of record ledgers and support distribution of a portion of any one entire ledger.\n\nRecords formats should (or could) be ‘subject’ orientated; with attributable records to that ‘subject’ being made available independent of other ‘subjects’ or related records.\n\nAn example may be that a device being used to find a toilet, doesn’t need the information about all public toilets in the world; they may only need to get the information about the toilets that are nearby. Operators of infrastructure in Australia are unlikely to reliably require information about toilets around the world, they may just need the information about ones that are located in the geographical region relating to the persons who their services, are serving.\n\n**Tamper evidence**\n\nEach record should be signed with a cryptographic instrument that provides the means for consumers of those data-files to check provenance & supplier of the record; as does relate to the issuer (or governor) of it. This is required for several reasons; including, providing a means to defend against ‘man in the middle’ AI (content / semantics level) attacks.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTransport security is a requirement. Cryptographic instruments should be used in a manner that is supportive of KYCC/AML related laws; whilst defending against unlicensed attack vectors / actors.\n\n(by ‘unlicensed’ i mean, unlawful acts by any party inclusive to authorities domestic or international)\n\n**Content Payloads (nb: i’ll figure out a better name later).**\n\nContent payloads are intended to support semantic informatics structures that are in-turn provided for the purposeful use of a semantic agent in relation to the creation and use of personal documents and related AI functions.\n\nThe operational & functional supply of _the informatics needs_ for software applications, requires the software to be able to process the information.\n\nMore broadly, the consideration is that much like downloading a copy of a blockchain (or torrent); the distribution of ‘knowledge’ and ‘information’ assets, that are able to be consumed by agents, is considered to be a functional requirement that should be supported by an approach that makes use of relevant (W3C, IETF, etc.) open standards.\n\nThese file structures should in-turn also support permissive use structures, which in-turn relates to the functional properties of services provided by knowledge banks. It is ordinarily impossible to ensure a copy of information that is successfully transmitted to another device, is able to be made inaccessible at a later date. Knowledge Banks, on the other hand, would be morally / legally obligated to perform this function; and are able to support queries by way of obtaining the query request, and processing it locally.\n\n**Content Object (ICON)**\n\nThe content payload should be able to be represented as an ICON with a short description, links and other ‘authorship’ related information (ie: inclusive to any license & governance related terms).\n\nFormat: SVG (can PNGs support this? Re: packaging, it might be easier to deliver in a HTML wrapper)\n\nUse cases:\n\n-   Providing ‘easy to use’ query object co-development\n\n> Ie: Sparql constituent of a query representing a search for a person with a particular attribute (gender, etc.). The utility of this is to form constituent sparql query objects that can form facets of a more complex query.\n\nFunctionally similar to an [openbadge](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) the principle objective is to improve usability and trust related attributes; as graphical, trade markable icons can be used to associate to the provider of a particular dataset resource.\n\n> Ie: Australian Bureau of Statistics ( or any other provider) icon & associated information\n\nPermissive Commons — Content Types\n\n-   Sparql Queries\n-   Ontologies\n-   ‘Open Data’\n-   Biosphere / Natural World Data-Sets\n-   Human World data sets (langage, etc.)\n-   Discovery / ‘information centric’ networking datasets\n\n**PERMISSIVE TREE SUPPORT**\n\nThe GIS (geographical information services) frameworks may incorporate information on a multitude of layers; that are in-turn likely to have an array of custodial relationships with an array of stakeholders.\n\n> A towns local government may govern the allocation of the spaces; including those of private property, whilst the utility of private-properties may have many owners overtime, involve real-estate agents; and tenants (those who rent the place and retain rights over the properties use).\n\nWhilst distinct, there are a series of similar ‘ecosystems’ evaluations that occur with all sorts of things in the real-world spaces, places & related things (of both a natural, man-made & artificial ‘cyber’ nature). This in-turn relates informatics structures to governance models, addressability and interactivity between ‘conscious minds’ and things; in a format that forms a multi-modal ‘graph’ nature; with temporal associations.\n\nPerhaps also, another important note may be to highlight the use-case of associations with [IoT, software interfaces and other ‘digital twin’ aspects](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2).\n\n**Notation Method**\n\nLinked data standards & related formats.\n\nFor reasons i do not entirely understand, it seems N3 might be the preferred serialisation format; and whilst documentation might focus on that, json-ld and other serialisation formats should be interchangeably supported.\n\nThe history of this is that TimBL defined N3 as an RDF Native serialisation (as described in his [design notes](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/)) but the problem was that developers who were building applications based on a ‘silo’ approach found it hard to grasp. To support RDF uses, _particularly_ for silo’d applications & related services, like search, the means to adapt JSON to support RDF was produced as JSON-LD.\n\nToday, there is alot of JSON-LD & JSON related APIs and services, alongside people who are more easily able to use it. Yet TimBL often remarks his preference for N3, and frankly — i think his a trustworthy guide on the issue.\n\nThe other factors worth noting are; a. serialisation formats are interchangeable, as can be demonstrated via [Any23](https://any23.apache.org/). Secondly, as the purposeful design of these ‘permissive commons’ structures are, by association to philosophical design, different to the otherwise well-developed centralised approaches; any additional barriers brought about by using N3 may serve as a reminder for the moral and ethical differences that relate to systems that are designed to support permissive commons structures.\n\n> noting also that the json license includes a stipulated term “[The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.](https://www.json.org/license.html)” that seems in many ways, far too vague.\n\n**Ability to support semantic cryptographic proofs**\n\nThe concept of ‘semantic proofs’ probably won’t make sense to most; generally, i’m saying that we can form methods to support ‘blockchain like’ functionality, without enormous dependencies on energy consumption as engendered through ‘proof of work’ schemes and formats.\n\nThe alternative illustrated therein; is about the use of social-semantics & cryptography in addition to cryptographic proofs. Some examples include [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof); but all together — there’s experts who know best.\n\n**Refining the definition of ‘permissive commons’: illustratively**\n\nAs illustrated above; if a person has a health problem, the best way to address it is to ensure those involved in the person / patients healthcare; are mutually able to be made aware of what it is that is going on.\n\n> This consideration does not extend to people who do not have a need to know.\n\nWhether it be mental health, gynaecological health or the many other fields; the patient should be the curator of who has access to their health information; whilst not being best placed to undertake meaningful actions that can improve health, based upon clinical insights engendered through studies.\n\nTherein; the consideration of ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ extends to the informatics patterns where select groups are permissively provided use of (point) data materials where required; and in-turn generate data themselves about what it is they did when interacting with that data.\n\ntherein also — simultaneously, the means for decentralised ‘data curators’ (ie: knowledge banks) to aggregate records as to render ‘anonymised’ results that can permissively be back-traced to the point data; for the purposes of legal audits (accountability) whilst not breaching privacy, is sought to be supported by these permissive protocol methodologies..\n\n**Compiled and component (signed) distributions**\n\nArtefact offerings provided by a permissive commons informatics distribution system should offer the ability to GET a compiled version; that incorporates the semantically referenced related datasets, in addition to an uncompiled (smaller) version; that requires GET requests when specified records relating to the dataset are required, but not available locally.\n\n(somewhat similar to some of the above notes)\n\n> Example 1: might be that someone gets a parking ticket (or speeding ticket) they want to dispute, and want to use data that is available to create a ‘verifiable claim’ in relation to their lodged dispute.\n\n> Example 2: A system requires an ‘offline’ copy, for activities in environments that have poor (or no) access to internet.\n\n### EXISTING WORKS\n\nTechnically, this proposition shares many qualities of existing solutions; and it is now desirable to get a subject matter expert involved to form the cohesive technical specification, method and proof of concept.\n\nConsiderations therein; include,\n\nGIT is a version control software that supports many of the local and networkable requirements; although some elements appear to not be available with existing solutions available today.\n\nThe benefit of using GIT is that it’s already built into the vast majority of web servers and is well-developed technology.\n\nBitTorrent (and similar) demonstrates the ability to resource a data-resource and distribute it using P2P techniques. WebTorrent and WebDHT are amongst the ‘family’ of solutions available, worthy of consideration.\n\n-   DAT\n-   IPFS\n-   Mango ([https://medium.com/@alexberegszaszi/mango-git-completely-decentralised-7aef8bcbcfe6](https://medium.com/@alexberegszaszi/mango-git-completely-decentralised-7aef8bcbcfe6) )\n-   Holochain (as distinct to the company ‘holo’ and its AUTH methodology)\n\n**Other Constituent Technology considerations**\n\n[**draft-cavage-http-signatures-10 - Signing HTTP Messages**  \n_Network Working Group M.

When asking ChatAI about Ending digital Slavery, it provided the following feedback;\n\n### ChatAI\n\nThere are a few different economic models that might be better suited to addressing the issue of unpaid or underpaid work, especially when it comes to knowledge workers. One approach could be to adopt a model that places a greater emphasis on workers' rights and the fair distribution of wealth. This could involve implementing policies that aim to reduce income inequality and provide a safety net for workers who are not being fairly compensated for their labor. Additionally, there could be a focus on providing training and education opportunities to help workers develop the skills they need to negotiate for better pay and working conditions. This could be coupled with stronger labor protections and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that workers are not exploited.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that should be avoided in order to end digital slavery, including:\n\n1.  Exploitative working conditions: Employers should ensure that workers are not subjected to excessive or unreasonable workloads, and that they are provided with fair pay and benefits.\n    \n2.  Forced labor: Employers should not use threats, intimidation, or coercion to force workers to perform labor against their will.\n    \n3.  Lack of worker protections: Employers should provide workers with adequate protections, including safety equipment and training, to prevent accidents or injuries on the job.\n    \n4.  Discrimination: Employers should not discriminate against workers on the basis of their race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Employers should have policies in place to prevent and address harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace.\n    \n6.  Lack of transparency: Employers should be transparent about their labor practices and should allow workers to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nThe principles for ending digital slavery can also be applied to open-source projects done online cooperatively with others. For example, it is important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are not subjected to exploitation or forced labor. This means that they should not be asked to work excessive hours or be paid unfairly for their contributions.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are treated fairly and with respect, and that there is no discrimination or harassment. This may involve having clear policies in place to address these issues and providing a safe and inclusive environment for all contributors.\n\nTransparency is also important in open-source projects. Contributors should be aware of the terms and conditions under which they are working, and should be able to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize that the contributions of open-source volunteers are valuable and should be treated with respect and fairness. By following these principles, open-source projects can be more inclusive and sustainable in the long term.\n\n## Notes and Considerations\n\nit is very difficult to simplify the notion of [[DigitalSlavery]] as is similarly the case in seeking to provide a simple summary of how it is these works act as a broad-ranging ecosystem with the express intent, of seeking to form apparatus that provides support for enabling lawful remedy in relation to these sorts of crimes and human rights abuses.   As such, when considering the points made about ending digital slavery, note that, the broader ecosystem if effectively implemented; has an effect, that is greater than any single part alone.  The success of the project is effectively defined by whether and/or how it supports #RealityCheckTech, without unreasonably compromising other broader values.  The webizen ecosystem produces an environment where technology, and by extension - Artificial intelligence, is curated as a set of tools for human kind to employ, as to be supported by those tools, and in-particular thereafter; be better equipped to be empowered to successfully engage in activities such as the broader [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]] - which is far less about ICT and far more about our biosphere and in-turn sociosphere; whereby, we need the tools to achieve more than is otherwise simply illustrated by the [[SDGs]]."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/SafetyProtocols/FreedomOfThought/","title":"Protecting Freedom of Thought"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Protecting Freedom of Thought\n\nFreedom of thought is the freedom of an individual to hold or consider a fact, opinion, or belief without interference or coercion. It is a fundamental human right that is protected by various national and international laws and agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of thought allows people to form and express their own beliefs and opinions, and to think and speak freely without fear of reprisal or punishment. It is an essential element of a free and democratic society, as it enables individuals to engage in critical thinking, debate, and the free exchange of ideas. Freedom of thought is often closely connected to other fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press.\n\nThere are a few key measures that are typically required to protect freedom of thought:\n\n1.  Legal protections: Freedom of thought is often protected by national and international laws and agreements that prohibit interference with an individual's right to hold and express their own beliefs and opinions.\n    \n2.  Political will: Governments and other authorities must be committed to protecting freedom of thought and be willing to take action to defend it when it is threatened.\n    \n3.  A robust civil society: A strong and active civil society, including media, NGOs, and other organizations, can help to promote and defend freedom of thought by advocating for the rights of individuals and holding authorities accountable.\n    \n4.  An informed and educated public: An informed and educated public is more likely to support and defend freedom of thought, as they are better equipped to understand the importance of this right and to recognize when it is being threatened.\n    \n5.  A culture of respect and tolerance: A culture that values diversity of thought and encourages respectful dialogue and debate can also help to protect freedom of thought.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that can threaten freedom of thought, including:\n\n1.  Censorship: Governments or other authorities may try to suppress certain ideas or beliefs by censoring information or punishing those who express certain viewpoints.\n    \n2.  Intimidation: Threats, harassment, or violence against those who hold or express certain beliefs can deter people from thinking or speaking freely.\n    \n3.  Propaganda: The use of misleading or biased information to manipulate public opinion or shape people's beliefs can undermine freedom of thought.\n    \n4.  Groupthink: Pressure to conform to the beliefs or opinions of a particular group can discourage independent thought and limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives.\n    \n5.  Lack of access to information: If people do not have access to a wide range of viewpoints and sources of information, they may be limited in their ability to think freely and form their own opinions.\n\n\n`#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/SafetyProtocols/GuardianshipRelations/","title":"Guardianship Relations"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Guardianship Relations\n\nHuman Centric AI must consider how it will support Guardianship Semantics in a manner that is consistant with the implied meaning of the instruments referred to as [[ValuesCredentials]] to provide [[SupportForHumanAgency]] for persons who require assistance from others; as has been something that i've sought to find solutions to address for a very long time.  \n\nMeans to address these requirements is essential for [[HumanCentricAI]].  \n\n## Guardianship Semantics\n\n### Introduction\n\nThere are various types of situations were 3rd parties have some sort of legal duty in relation to others.  Common examples include children, elderly persons and those with severe disabilities, that act to impair their ability to be independently capable of managing their own lives and/or rights and responsibilities.\n\nWhen seeking to form an information systems methodology to support personal human agency and fundamental support for the human rights of all persons; this area of decision making appears to be a particularly difficult area to define what the most appropriate rules and related requirements should be.  It is not uncommon for persons who are subject to guardianship relations / duties, as are enacted in some way that has the effect of others being responsible for that person; to be used in a manner that does not serve their best interests.  Equally, the intepretation of what may be in their best interests vs. what it is that any such person subject to any such form of legal framework wants, may be quite different.\n\nIn some cases; there is no good legal standing that exists to more easily support information management related assertions via Technology Platform Providers and related systems and authorities; which in-turn, likely invokes a requirement to form appropriate [[SafetyProtocols]] that provide a series of policies and responsibilities about how various types of situations are judged to be best handled; and in-turn also, what the repercussive implications may be in circumstances where these sorts of rules are subject to some form of improper [[SocialAttackVectors]] related event.\n\nThis document will be expanded upon to further define some high-level considerations about how it is that these sorts of requirements will be addressed on a [[BestEfforts]] basis\n\nSome progress was made by entering the query and related considerations to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), which provided information per below.  \n\nDescription provided to ChatGPT:\n\nI am working on software that supports entity logic. \n\nIn this design logic; \n\nThe term Entity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).   \n\nThe terms Agent Centric and Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'. and,\n\nThe term Human Centric refers to the orientation of information management systems that centre upon the rights, responsibilities and moral ownership of electronic records pertaining to a human being. \n\nSome Human Beings are not able to make legal decisions or hold legal responsibility on their own behalf.  This may be due to disability, psychiatric illness, aging related conditions, emergency medical situations as well as consideration for the needs of children.  This may be considered to relate to persons who have some sort of guardianship requirements to support the persons human rights.\n\nIf each Adult Human being is able to own, store and operate their own data / information and manage their own authentication and permissions systems, but that this cannot be achieved for persons who require some sort of guardianship support; how could systems be designed to support the safety and human dignity / human rights of persons who require guardianship related shared permissions structures and how could those permission structures be defined to support the persons human rights / human dignity?\n\n\nChat AI:\n\n*In terms of technical solutions, systems can be designed to support flexible permission structures that can be tailored to the specific needs of each individual. For example, the system could allow for different levels of access and control depending on the individual's needs and abilities. For example, individuals who require more support may have more limited access to their data, while those who are able to make decisions on their own may have more autonomy.*\n\n*In terms of policy-based solutions, systems can be designed to incorporate principles such as transparency, accountability, and privacy by design. These principles can help ensure that the system is designed with the protection of the individual's rights and dignity in mind, and that any decisions or actions taken on their behalf are fully justified and transparent.*\n\n*In addition, having clear protocols for guardianship and determining guardianship, and clear transparent communication channels for guardianship decision making would be essential. This can be achieved by having legal frameworks that clearly outline the responsibilities and rights of all parties involved, as well as regular reviews to ensure that the individual's needs are being met and that the guardianship is still needed.*\n\n*Ultimately, it is important to involve individuals who require guardianship, their guardians and other stakeholders in the design process to ensure that the system is tailored to their specific needs and that it meets their safety, security and human rights standards.*\n\n\nQ: if a person who requires guardianship is defined as a dependant; who still retains human rights, but is dependant upon one or more others to be supported to maintain a beneficial relationship with those rights; What technical designs could provide the dependent their own digital human agency, perhaps through the ownership of a database that contains their information; but is supported by others who also have access? how might the information be categorised to appropriately provide support, as well as maintaining the dependants right to privacy and freedom of thought?\n\nChatGPT:\n*One approach to providing a dependent with their own digital human agency, while also supporting them with access to their information, could be to use a decentralized database system. This type of system would allow the dependent to have control over their own data, while also allowing designated individuals, such as guardians, to have access to the data as needed.*\n\n*The information in the database could be organized in such a way that it supports the dependent's needs and rights, while also protecting their privacy. For example, sensitive personal information could be kept private and only shared with designated individuals on a need-to-know basis. Information that is needed to support the dependent's daily needs could be more easily accessible by their guardians.*\n\n*One way to organize the information to support the dependent is to use a hierarchical structure where personal data is separated into different levels of privacy and accessibility. For example, the dependent could have full control over the highest level of data, which includes information such as their medical history, contact information, and personal preferences. The lower level of data is shared with the designated guardians or support people and it can contain information such as appointments, social and other interactions that the dependant would have.*\n\n*Another design solution could be to use a permission-based system, where the dependent and their guardians can assign different levels of access to the data for different individuals or groups. For example, the dependent may allow their primary guardian to have full access to all of their data, while other family members or caregivers may have more limited access. Additionally, consider setting up expiration dates for access, so that the data is not indefinitely accessible.*\n\n*To maintain the dependent's right to privacy and freedom of thought, it is also important to have clear policies and procedures in place for handling data, as well as regular audits to ensure that the system is in compliance with regulations, standards and to assure dependant's information is being handled appropriately. Additionally, involving the dependant in the decision making process and choices of the systems, protocols and policies that would be employed to support their human agency can help ensure that their needs and rights are being met.*\n\n*Another important aspect of maintaining the dependent's right to privacy and freedom of thought is to provide them with the necessary tools and resources to understand and manage their own data. This could include providing training and education on how to use the database and permission system, as well as giving them access to clear and easy-to-understand information about their rights and the policies and procedures that apply to their data.*\n\n*Additionally, involving the dependent in the decision-making process when it comes to the use of their data, can be essential. For example, they can have a voice in which of the data they allow to be shared with which parties, and under what conditions.*\n\n*Finally, it is important to have robust security measures in place to protect the dependent's data from unauthorized access or misuse. This can include using encryption, secure authentication methods, and regular backups to protect the data from loss or damage.*\n\n*In summary, providing a dependent with their own digital human agency can be achieved through the use of decentralized databases and permission-based systems that allow the dependent to have control over their own data, while also allowing designated individuals to have access as needed. The system should be designed to support the dependent's needs and rights, while also protecting their privacy, including through the use of hierarchical data structure, expiration date of access, and involving the dependant in the decision making process of sharing and managing the data. To maintain dependant's rights, security measures must be in place, as well as clear policies and procedures for handling the data, regular audits and involving dependant in the decision making process.*\n\nQ: What sorts of policy based mechanisms would be required and/or beneficial to support the human rights of the dependant?\n\nChatGPT:\n\n*There are a variety of policy-based mechanisms that can be implemented to support the human rights of a dependent. Some of these include:*\n\n1.  *Clear legal frameworks: Establishing clear legal frameworks that outline the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved in supporting the dependent, including their guardians, caregivers, and family members. These frameworks should also provide guidelines for decision making and dispute resolution.*\n    \n2.  *Human rights-based approach: Ensuring that the approach taken to support the dependent is based on the principles of human rights, including the right to autonomy, privacy, and dignity. This should include regular reviews of the dependent's needs and the effectiveness of the support being provided, to ensure that their rights are being respected.*\n    \n3.  *Transparency and accountability: Implementing systems and procedures that promote transparency and accountability in the handling of the dependent's data and in the decision-making process around their care. This can include regular reporting, regular audits, and mechanisms for addressing grievances.*\n    \n4.  *Privacy and security: Developing and implementing policies and procedures that protect the dependent's privacy and personal information, including strict protocols for data handling, regular security reviews, and the use of encryption, authentication and access control mechanisms.*\n    \n5.  *Participation and informed consent: Involving the dependent in the decision-making process, providing them with the information necessary to understand the choices being made, and ensuring that they are able to provide informed consent.*\n    \n6.  *Independent oversight: Having independent oversight and regular review mechanisms to ensure that the dependent's rights are being respected and protected, and to identify and address any concerns or issues that may arise.*\n    \n7.  *Monitoring: Establishing regular monitoring, reporting and review mechanisms to ensure compliance with the above mentioned policy based mechanisms and identify and addressing any issues.*\n    \n\n*It is important to note that, depending on the specific context and needs of the dependent, additional policy mechanisms may be necessary to ensure their human rights are protected.*\n\n\nQ: If a dependant is unable to independently own or lawfully protect (ie: via courts of law) their own rights relating the ownership, storage and use of their own personal and private information; how might a legal structure be devised to support their needs, with the support of others?\n\nChatGPT:\n\n*If a dependent is unable to independently own or lawfully protect their own rights relating to the ownership, storage, and use of their personal and private information, a legal structure could be devised to support their needs with the support of others.*\n\n*One approach could be to establish a legal guardianship or conservatorship system. This would involve a legal process where a designated guardian or conservator is appointed by a court to make decisions on the dependent's behalf regarding their personal and private information. The guardian or conservator would be responsible for managing the dependent's data and ensuring that their rights and interests are protected.*\n\n*Another approach could be to establish a legal trust, where the dependent's data would be held in trust by a designated trustee. The trustee would be responsible for managing and protecting the dependent's data, in accordance with the terms of the trust and any court orders. This legal trust can be tailored to the specific needs of the dependant and the level of autonomy they wish to retain.*\n\n*The legal structure that is chosen would need to be in compliance with the local jurisdiction laws, while also taking into account of the needs and autonomy of the dependent person. Additionally, it would need to be reviewed and updated on regular basis.*\n\n*In both cases, the legal structure would need to provide for oversight and accountability to ensure that the dependent's rights and interests are protected, and to address any issues or concerns that may arise. This could be through regular reporting, regular reviews, or mechanisms for dispute resolution, as appropriate.*\n\n*It is also important to consider involving a range of stakeholders in the design and implementation of such legal structures, such as the dependant, their guardians, family members and other support people. This will help ensure that the legal structure meets the specific needs of the dependent, respects their autonomy and rights, and is tailored to the dependant's individual needs and circumstances.*\n\n*Another approach to support the needs of dependants with the support of others could be by creating a power of attorney (POA). A power of attorney is a legal document that gives someone else the authority to make decisions on behalf of the person who has granted the POA. This could be a general POA which gives someone the authority to make all types of decisions, or a specific POA which gives someone the authority to make specific types of decisions related to personal and private information. In this case, the person granting the POA (the principal) would have the right to choose who their attorney-in-fact (the person they have chosen to act on their behalf) will be, and what kind of power they will have. The attorney-in-fact should act in the best interest of the principal, and in this case of the dependent, the attorney-in-fact would manage the dependent's personal and private information according to the terms of the POA and the best interest of the dependent.*\n\n*Another potential legal solution that might support dependants and their rights over their personal and private information, could be the creation of a legal representative. This could be a person, or an organization that is legally designated to represent the dependent in the management and protection of their personal and private information. This legal representative would be responsible for making decisions related to the dependent's information, such as sharing it with others or managing the privacy settings, and would act in the best interest of the dependent, while also complying with legal requirements.*\n\n*It is also important to mention that, any solution that is chosen, it should not limit or restrict the dependent's rights more than is necessary to protect their best interests and they should be included in the decision making process and have the right to revoke the legal structure if they choose to do so.*\n\n*In summary, there are a number of legal structures that can be devised to support the needs of dependants with the support of others, such as legal guardianship or conservatorship, legal trust, power of attorney, and legal representative. The specific legal structure chosen will depend on the jurisdiction and the specific needs and circumstances of the dependent. It is important to note that, regardless of the legal structure chosen, it should prioritize the dependent's autonomy and rights while also ensuring they are protected and their best interest is taken into account.*\n\nQ: How could a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier; be devised using contract law between private individuals, that may in-turn expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met?\n\nChatGPT:\n\n*It is possible to devise a solution using contract law between private individuals that attends to the considerations provided earlier and that may expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met. One example of such a contract could be a personal data management contract.*\n\n*This type of contract would outline the terms and conditions of how the dependent's personal and private information will be managed and protected. The contract would be between the dependent (or the person legally responsible for them) and the person or organization designated to manage their data, such as a guardian, attorney-in-fact, or legal representative. The contract would include information such as the scope of the data that is being managed, the rights and responsibilities of each party, and the conditions under which the contract may be terminated or modified.*\n\n*The contract could include an expiration clause, which would specify a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. For example, the contract could expire when the dependent reaches a certain age or when their condition improves to a point where they are able to manage their data independently.*\n\n*In addition, the contract should include provisions for regular reviews of the terms and conditions of the contract to ensure that it is still meeting the needs of the dependent and that their rights are being protected. It should also include provisions for dispute resolution, in case of any disagreement about the contract's terms or the management of the data.*\n\n*It is important to note that any contract involving personal data should comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws, and that the dependent should be involved in the contract creation, review and termination process.*\n\n*In summary, a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier could be devised using contract law between private individuals. This contract, such as a personal data management contract, would outline the terms and conditions of how the dependent's personal and private information will be managed and protected and includes an expiration clause that specifies a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. It should also include provisions for regular reviews and dispute resolution and comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws.*\n\n*Another important aspect of this type of contract would be its enforceability. It's important to make sure that the contract is legally binding and that the rights and obligations of the parties are clearly defined and enforceable in court if needed. This can be done by including specific language in the contract that makes it clear that it is intended to be legally binding and that the parties have read and understood the terms of the contract before signing.*\n\n*Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider involving legal professionals in the drafting and review of the contract, to ensure that it meets the legal requirements and that it's terms are fair and reasonable to all parties involved.*\n\n*It's also worth noting that, in some cases the contract could be used in parallel with or as part of a legal framework that is established by the government such as a guardianship or conservatorship structure, or a legal trust. In this case, the contract would need to be aligned with and comply with the legal framework that is in place.*\n\n*In summary, a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier could be devised using contract law between private individuals, that may in-turn expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met. This type of contract, would provide clear and enforceable terms and conditions for the management and protection of the dependent's personal and private information, and would include an expiration clause that specifies a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. It should be legally binding and comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws. It's recommended to involve legal professionals in the drafting and review of the contract, to ensure that it meets the legal requirements and it's terms are fair and reasonable for all parties involved.*\n\nQ: make a list of the types of circumstances relating to a human being for whom these sorts of requirements are needed to support.\n\n1.  *Children or young people who are not yet legally able to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n2.  *Individuals with cognitive or developmental disabilities that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n3.  *Elderly individuals who are experiencing cognitive decline or have diminished capacity to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n4.  *Individuals with mental illness that affects their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n5.  *Individuals who are in emergency medical situations and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n6.  *Individuals who are incapacitated as a result of a physical or neurological injury or illness*\n7.  *Individuals who have a temporary or permanent loss of consciousness or brain function*\n8.  *Individuals who are in a state of extreme distress and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n9.  *Individuals who are under the care of a court-appointed guardian or conservator*\n10.  *Individuals who are in a long-term care facility or receiving in-home care.*\n11.  *Individuals who have suffered a traumatic event or have been victims of abuse, which may affect their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.*\n12.  *Individuals with addiction or substance abuse problems that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.*\n13.  *Individuals who are in prison or detention centers, and may be limited in their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.*\n14.  *Individuals with a history of homelessness, or who are currently experiencing homelessness, and may have limited access to information management and technology.*\n15.  *Individuals who are living in remote or rural areas, and may have limited access to services and support that would help them manage their personal and private information.*\n\n*It's important to note that, this list is not exhaustive and there may be other types of circumstances where support to manage personal and private information is needed, it's important to evaluate each situation and the needs of the person on a case by case basis.*\n\n*It's important to keep in mind that individuals may experience temporary or permanent changes in their abilities and require different levels of support to manage their personal and private information. The key is to work with the individual and assess their specific needs to provide the appropriate level of support and to make sure that their human rights and autonomy are respected.*\n\nQ: please define an ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL SKOS, SOIC and SHACL that illustrates an example of how this might work.\n\n*An ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, SHACL and SOIC to illustrate an example of how this might work would be a complex task, as it would involve several steps, such as identifying the classes, properties, and relationships in the domain, defining the concepts and their hierarchies, and specifying the constraints and rules that govern the data.*\n\n*However, I can provide an overview of how such an ontology might be structured, and some examples of the types of classes, properties, and relationships that would be used to represent the domain.*\n\n- *RDF (Resource Description Framework) would be used to define the basic structure of the ontology, providing a way to represent resources and the relationships between them.*\n    \n- *RDFS (RDF Schema) would be used to define classes and properties, and to provide a way to specify the hierarchical relationships between classes and properties.*\n    \n- *OWL (Web Ontology Language) would be used to provide more advanced modeling features, such as expressing cardinality and property restrictions, and defining classes and properties as equivalent or disjoint.*\n    \n- *SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) would be used to express concepts and their relationships, and to provide a way to organize and browse the concepts in the ontology.*\n    \n- *SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) would be used to specify constraints and rules that govern the data, such as data types, cardinality, and allowed values.*\n    \n- *SOIC (Supporting Open Identity & Control) would be used to express information related to the human identity, their rights, and access management.*\n    \n\n*As an example, the ontology might include classes such as \"Dependent\", \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\", where \"Dependent\" would be a subclass of \"Person\" and \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\" would be subclasses of \"Agent\". The classes would be related through properties such as \"hasGuardian\" and \"hasDataManager\" where the properties would be defined as object properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\" respectively. The ontology would also include classes such as \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" which would be related through properties such as \"hasPersonalInformation\" and \"hasPrivacyRights\" where the properties would be defined as object properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" respectively. The ontology might also include properties such as \"accessLevel\" and \"permission\" which would be defined as data properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" respectively, to indicate the level of access and permission granted to the different parties involved.*\n\n*The ontology would also include a class \"Data Management Contract\" which would be related to \"Dependent\", \"Guardian\", \"Data Manager\" and \"Personal Information\" through properties such as \"hasContract\", \"hasDependent\", \"hasGuardian\", \"hasDataManager\" and \"hasPersonalInformation\" to indicate the parties involved and the terms and conditions of the contract.*\n\n*In addition, the ontology could also include classes such as \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\" that would be related through properties such as \"compliesWith\" linking \"Data Management Contract\" with \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\" respectively to indicate the laws that the contract must comply with.*\n\n*It's important to note that this is a high level example and the details of the ontology would have to be fleshed out further, with a more detailed understanding of the domain and specific requirements. Also, the use of different vocabularies and ontologies, it is important to ensure that the ontology is consistent and coherent and that the different vocabularies and ontologies are used in a way that is consistent with their intended purpose. In addition, it is important to use established vocabularies and ontologies when they are available, to make sure that the ontology is compatible with other ontologies and can be integrated with other systems.*\n\n*Furthermore, one important aspect of the ontology is to make it flexible, to allow for future changes and extensions. It should be easy to update, to add new classes, properties and relationships, and to change the existing definitions as new information is acquired.*\n\n*In summary, an ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, SHACL and SOIC to illustrate an example of how the support for dependants over their personal and private information might work, would involve several steps and could make use of different vocabularies and ontologies to create a coherent and consistent model that represents the domain, while also being flexible enough to allow for future updates and extensions. The ontology would need to include classes and properties that represent the different parties involved, the personal and private information, the contract and the laws. It should also include relationships that express the connections between these different components, and constraints that ensure data accuracy and consistency, while also complying with the legal requirements.*\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nThe full description of what the Webizen ecosystem is and how it is intended to work was not provided to the ChatGPT system; therefore, the ontology solution statements were not able to address the specific design related requirements, as that information wasn't provided to it. \n\nWhilst the outline provided by ChatGPT provides some usefully progressive 3rd party input (that was otherwise broadly sought, yet still absent); the details, will take alot of time and effort to better define as to form some sort of useful specification, for each usecase example, which i consider to be a non-trivial (series of) task(s). \n\nHowever; importantly, rather than defining a database for persons relating to these sorts of requirements - being defined merely as subclasses of `owl:thing` some insight is able to be progressed in-order to support "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/SafetyProtocols/InformationPortability/","title":"Information Portability"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Information Portability\n\nData Portability is an essential requirement for various reasons.  \n\nThe works performed by this Web Civics - Human Centric AI Community will at all times make [[BestEfforts]] to seek to ensure that the tooling that is produced does not have the effect of binding persons to any gainful relationship of dependence in a manner that if done via means other than through the use of technology would clearly breach [[ValuesCredentials]] related terms and considerations.\n\nThe [Data Portability Project](https://datatransferproject.dev/) whose Current Contributors include Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, SmugMug and Twitter is an example, and the GitHub Repo for it is: [google/data-transfer-project](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project) \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/SafetyProtocols/ProtectingDependants/","title":"Protecting Dependants"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Protecting Dependants \n\n\nAll persons who are involved with Web Civics and/or any of its projects, including but not exclusive to this Human Centric AI community initiative; is expected, at all times, to act in a manner that seeks to protect the inaliable Human Rights of Children and any other persons who may be considered to have a relationship of dependence upon the implications of these works.

Yet when this occurs, some jobs may be identified and defined as necessary work to achieve a particular outcome; whilst other works that other people may seek to do, may be unsolicited and entirely undertaken on their own basis; and the usefulness of that work is unknown. I am looking to define a Contribution Classification system that can categorise different types of contributions so that the distinctions can be better made understandable to other people, and in-turn provide a means to create different types of contractual obligations about the use of those persons work. What Contribution Classifications do you think are important to define?\n\n>A: There are several potential contribution classifications that might be important to define when creating a system for categorizing different types of contributions in the context of online knowledge work. Some potential classifications to consider might include:\n\n>1.  Necessary contributions: These are contributions that are identified as necessary for the successful completion of a project. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are specifically assigned to individuals or that are essential for the project to move forward.\n    \n> 2.  Unsolicited contributions: These are contributions that are made by individuals without being specifically requested or assigned. They may be undertaken on a volunteer basis or as part of an individual's personal interest in the project.\n    \n> 3.  Valued contributions: These are contributions that are considered to be particularly valuable or beneficial to the project. They may be identified through feedback or evaluation processes, or through other means of assessment.\n    \n> 4.  Collaborative contributions: These are contributions that involve collaboration or teamwork with others. They may involve the exchange of ideas, the sharing of resources or expertise, or other forms of collaboration.\n    \n> Overall, it may be useful to define these and other contribution classifications in order to better understand the different types of contributions being made to a project and to create appropriate contractual obligations related to the use of those contributions.\n\n> Other potential contribution classifications to consider might include:\n\n> 5.  Time-limited contributions: These are contributions that are made on a temporary or short-term basis. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are specific to a particular phase or stage of the project, or that are completed within a specific timeframe.\n    \n> 6.  Ongoing contributions: These are contributions that are made on a more long-term or ongoing basis. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are ongoing or that are expected to continue over a longer period of time.\n    \n> 7.  Discrete contributions: These are contributions that are self-contained or that can be completed independently of other contributions. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are discrete or that can be completed on a standalone basis.\n    \n> 8.  Interdependent contributions: These are contributions that are dependent on or interconnected with other contributions. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that rely on the work of others in order to be completed or that are part of a larger system or process.\n    \n> Overall, it may be useful to define these and other contribution classifications in order to better understand the different types of contributions being made to a project and to create appropriate contractual obligations related to the use of those contributions.

Some potential classifications to consider might include:\n\n> 1.  Different types of work: This classification could involve subcategories for different types of tasks or responsibilities, such as design work, research, programming, testing, etc.\n    \n> 2.  Contributions of resources or equipment and supplies: This classification could involve subcategories for different types of resources or supplies that are contributed to the project, such as software, hardware, data, etc.\n    \n> 3.  Contributions of intellectual property: This classification could involve subcategories for different types of intellectual property contributions, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.\n    \n> 4.  Contributions on defined terms: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are made on specific terms or conditions, such as contributions made under a particular license or agreement.\n    \n> Overall, it may be useful to define these and other contribution classifications in order to better understand the different types of contributions being made to a project and to create appropriate contractual obligations related to the use of those contributions. This could help to ensure that the contributions are recognized and valued appropriately and that the rights and obligations of the parties involved are clearly defined.\n\n>Other potential contribution classifications to consider might include:\n\n> 5.  Expertise-based contributions: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are based on specific expertise or skills, such as contributions of knowledge or expertise in a particular field or domain.\n    \n> 6.  Role-based contributions: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are related to specific roles or responsibilities, such as contributions made by project managers, team leaders, or other key stakeholders.\n    \n> 7.  Collaborative contributions: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that involve collaboration or teamwork with others, such as contributions that involve the exchange of ideas or the sharing of resources or expertise.\n    \n> 8.  Standalone contributions: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are self-contained or that can be completed independently of other contributions, such as contributions that are discrete or that can be completed on a standalone basis.\n    \n> Overall, it may be useful to define these and other contribution classifications in order to better understand the different types of contributions being made to a project and to create appropriate contractual obligations related to the use of those contributions.

In the context of online systems, contract law can be used to establish the terms of service for websites and other online platforms, to govern the sale of goods or services online, and to resolve disputes that may arise between parties.\n>\n>Online contracts can take many forms, including written agreements, click-through agreements, and terms of service. These contracts may be used to define the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved, as well as to set out the terms and conditions under which the contract will be performed.\n>\n>In the event of a dispute, contract law can be used to interpret the terms of an online contract and to determine the rights and obligations of the parties involved. Contract law can also be used to enforce the terms of an online contract, including through the use of damages or other remedies.\n>\n>Overall, contract law plays a critical role in modern online systems, providing a framework for regulating agreements and interactions between parties and for resolving disputes that may arise.\n\nQ: Describe the implications Choice of law in terms of service agreements for modern online systems that store the information provided by users.\n\n> A: Choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for modern online systems that store user information can have significant implications for the parties involved. These provisions can determine which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the terms of the agreement, and can therefore impact the rights and obligations of the parties.\n> \n> For example, choice of law provisions can affect the level of protection afforded to user data and the rights of users to access and control their data. They can also impact the liability of the online platform for any breaches of the terms of service or for any harm caused to users as a result of the platform's actions or failures.\n> \n> In addition, choice of law provisions can affect the enforceability of the terms of the agreement and the ability of users to bring legal actions against the online platform. They can also impact the availability of remedies for any breaches of the agreement, such as damages or injunctive relief.\n> \n> Overall, choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems that store user information can have significant implications for the rights and obligations of the parties involved and can affect the enforceability and effectiveness of the agreement.\n> \n> In order to ensure that choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems are effective and enforceable, it is important for the parties to carefully consider the jurisdiction whose laws will apply to the agreement. This may involve considering factors such as the location of the parties, the location of the online platform, and the nature of the services being provided.\n> \n> It may also be necessary to consider the laws of multiple jurisdictions, as online systems may operate globally and may be subject to the laws of multiple countries. In these cases, it may be necessary to include provisions that specify which laws will apply in different circumstances or that allow the parties to choose which laws will apply.\n> \n> Overall, choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems can have significant implications for the parties involved, and it is important for the parties to carefully consider which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the agreement in order to ensure that the provisions are effective and enforceable.\n\nQ: What are the implications if a user is considered to be a 'legal alien' (ie: foreigner) in relation to the elected choice of law provision in a terms of service contract?\n\n> A: If a user is considered to be a \"legal alien\" (i.e., a foreigner) in relation to the elected choice of law provision in a terms of service contract, there may be several implications for the user. Some of these implications could include:\n> \n> 1.  Limited legal protections: The laws of the jurisdiction chosen in the choice of law provision may not provide the same level of legal protection to foreign users as they do to domestic users. This could leave foreign users more vulnerable to harm or abuse.\n\n> 2.  Difficulty enforcing rights: If a foreign user wishes to enforce their rights under the terms of service contract, they may face challenges in doing so if the chosen jurisdiction's laws do not provide them with adequate legal protections or if the jurisdiction does not have a strong legal system.\n \n> 3.  Higher costs: Foreign users may also face higher costs in enforcing their rights or seeking remedies for any breaches of the terms of service contract, as they may need to retain legal counsel in the chosen jurisdiction or engage in litigation in a foreign court.\n   \n> Overall, if a user is considered to be a \"legal alien\" in relation to the elected choice of law provision in a terms of service contract, they may face challenges in enforcing their rights and may have limited legal protections under the chosen jurisdiction's laws.\n\n\n> If a user is considered to be a \"legal alien\" (i.e., a foreigner) in relation to intellectual property rights (IPR), there may be several implications for the user. Some of these implications could include:\n\n> 1.

This could include rates of return in the range of 10-20% or higher.*\n\n*However, it is important to note that these rates are only estimates, and the actual rate of return that an investor or lender is seeking may vary significantly based on the specific details of the project and the investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives. It is also worth noting that the rate of return sought by an investor or lender may not necessarily reflect the rate of return that the project is able to generate.*\n\n*Overall, it is important for entrepreneurs seeking funding for early stage projects to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any unsecured loans they are considering, including the rate of return being sought by the investor or lender.*\n\nQ: What is the typical return on investment expectation for Early Stage Venture Capital?\n\nA: *The typical return on investment (ROI) expectation for early stage venture capital can vary widely depending on a number of factors, including the stage of the company, the industry sector, and the specific investment strategy of the venture capital firm.*\n\n*In general, venture capital firms that invest in early stage companies are typically seeking higher rates of return to compensate for the higher level of risk involved. According to some estimates, venture capital firms may typically aim for an ROI of 3-5 times their initial investment over a period of 5-7 years.*\n\n*However, it is important to note that these are only estimates, and the actual ROI achieved by a venture capital firm may vary significantly based on the specific details of the investment. Venture capital investing is generally considered to be a high-risk, high-reward proposition, and it is not uncommon for some investments to fail to deliver any return, while others may achieve significantly higher returns.*\n\n*Overall, it is important for entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any investment offer, including the expected ROI and the time frame in which the venture capital firm expects to see a return on its investment.*\n\n**Q:**  What would be the fixed rate of return if the compensatory amount for a successful venture was capped to a specified fixed multiplier or percentage, for an early stage project?\n\nA: *The fixed rate of return if the compensatory amount for a successful venture is capped to a specified fixed multiplier or percentage for an early stage project would depend on the specific terms and conditions of the investment.*\n\n*For example, if the compensatory amount is capped at a fixed multiplier of 2x the initial investment, and the initial investment is $100,000, the fixed rate of return would be 100% (2x the initial investment), assuming that the project is successful and the cap is reached.*\n\n*On the other hand, if the compensatory amount is capped at a fixed percentage of the initial investment, such as 50%, and the initial investment is $100,000, the fixed rate of return would be $50,000 (50% of the initial investment), assuming that the project is successful and the cap is reached.*\n\n*It is important to note that fixed multipliers and percentages can be used in a variety of different investment structures, and the specific terms and conditions of an investment will vary depending on the specific details of the project and the preferences of the investor. It is up to the investor to carefully consider the terms and conditions of the investment, including any caps on the compensatory amount, before making a decision.* \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Projects/WorkProject/Resources/","title":"Resources"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Resources are any materials, assets, or inputs that are used to produce goods or services.

All of them contribute to collaboration in seeking to produce information systems designed to support fairness via reward systems in a decentralized way, by providing a commons friendly ways of accounting. \n\nThese solutions seek to define value flows which then can be placed in a ledger, collective intelligence system or spreadsheet for contributive accounting, open value accounting and collaborative accounting. \n\n#### Aim of the document \n\nThis document aims to harvest the IT solutions found and practical tools used. It does not broadly expand to the organizational models behind them. However via the links and in the demonstrative images some of that becomes visible too.\n\nTiberius Brastaviceanu (founder Sensorica) justly said: “An organisation is a living system. One cannot just talk about an IT-infrastructure. Tools are only one aspect of an organisation, and their nature depends on the nature of the organisation.”\n\nThe underlying document is meant to demonstrate what is being developed in the p2p world until now and creates a foundation for us to create a knowledge banking methodology and organizational structure. As we hoped to be able to do accounting while we work towards this structure on the basis of this foundation, we are not sure yet that this is possible. So this is a temporary basis for which we wanted to investigate existing initiatives and practical solutions.\n\n## What are we looking for?\n\nWhat we are looking for is: existing methods of open value or contribution accounting for teams of freelancers / startups / scale ups that have been used till now. Favorably with a link to tax requirements, billing, transparent transaction, value flows and open value systems.\n\nWelcoming also analysis on the difficulties in collaborative accounting / group accounting / the shift to working in groups rather than as individuals and how this relates to present day tax systems / accounting systems and the embedding of new collaboration rules in tooling / technology.\n\nI.e. blockchain is and was promising to create something like measurable value and reputation, yet it is detached from the ordinary rules of accounting, so hard to have a one click go for billing / transaction of tokens / coins / (money). Creating economical space for renewal is wonderful, but how does it translate to the ordinary requirements? If there is an accounting system that already does that translation: from individualized work / corporate work structures to collaborative open value accounting: what were the pitfalls? Are there open ends? Are there specific learnings in that trajectory and questions to be answered still?\n\n### Solutions available in the marketplace\n\nThe below examples illustrate an array of projects that are working towards a similar goal. \n\nInstructions: please feel welcome to add other solutions in-line as a contribution (suggestion) or as a comment - for us to find and review.\n\nSolutions are of a different nature: from spreadsheets or working tools for money allocation and evaluation and management of hours and tasks / roles to blockchain solutions and open value accounting to transformative models for a new economy. Some working, some in development. \n\n### [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/)\n\nOuiShare operated before blockchain was available in spreadsheets exercising the idea of blockchain and open value accounting / having a basic income idea of spreading money over projects in ordinary spreadsheets. Prognosing the outcome of efforts and the distribution of money as well as collaboratively evaluating efforts and money streams.\n\n\nOld: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNew:\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nBasic income try out with project budgets (50% of OuiShare’s then annual budget available for non solid issues):\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n### [Cobudget](https://cobudget.co/) (also used by Enspiral)\n\nCurrently OuiShare and Enspiral use Cobudget as a tool to manage money. Cobudget is a tool and a methodology that makes resource allocation participatory. It enables all members of an organization to get involved in decision-making by proposing projects and allocating funds to the proposals they like. What it does not do is verify if money transactions have factually been made. It does not do the accountancy either. It is a front where collaborative decisions about money can be made transparently. The factual handling of the transactions and accounting have to be done elsewhere.\n\n[https://cobudget.co/](https://cobudget.co/)\n\n ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pCktwuaYUi5c5jBDz6u0B6L9RvjxpeeKiJ7-R9srUk0ADq07PjTNs9WYTOYwaIPDDDdUV8cwq12-KYv_q8WniMr6VaO6DEAOT4CnHOfGytDSlrTukv5ZLUCJ0hGgeNzHYkq6TwI_gHPPpQG--rlNM2807D7nZLxIjzF98z0EBVeT6oGM60NpcZuSmF0g)\n\n### [Backfeed](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\nBackfeed attended the OuiShare summit in 2015 starting up a project together with OuiShare to create the first blockchain based experiment of open value accounting in which each and everyone’s needs and contributions are met with adequate rewarding out of existing budgets. An important new development was the measuring of ‘reputation’ as well as ‘value’ in the form of tokens, which led to jokes about ‘now I will lose all of my reputation’ and the like.\n\n\nUntil 2016:\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf)\n\n[http://github.com/Backfeed](http://github.com/Backfeed)\n\n\nExperiment in OuiShare in 2016:\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1](https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2](https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3](https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3)\n\n\nUpdates and articles:\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society](https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society)\n\n[http://magazine.backfeed.cc/](http://magazine.backfeed.cc/)\n\n\nGeneral notes on the meaning of blockchain and decentralization of OuiShare Fest 2016: \n\n[https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain](https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain)\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OPm49wqSN3bH6JtGsx4csyBdqYIgRenuQIB5-7bNksgh_T8_gvKplgPnCBxVlZSfu2axhqYaBwCzJ6PhpfefVyBpwzg3qNrLjt9hBdC0SWz2GDfMFzQyG0s-m1TNShCJlKu250Yc8oxv6Kg5MzyROyTOKm6oGj0LZIYSj9KRdHNTTXyeFxbu_i9N_vxW)\n\n### [Daostack](https://daostack.io/) \n\nBackfeed has been stopped as a project and went into a next initiative: Daostack.\n\n[https://daostack.io/](https://daostack.io/)\n\n[https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf](https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf)\n\n[https://github.com/daostack](https://github.com/daostack)\n\n\nRelation with Backfeed:\n\n[https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29](https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1)\n\n\nDaostack articles:\n\n[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/)\n\n[https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/](https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6)\n\n\nA synthesis of the answer provided by DAOstack’s architect Matan Field is that with Backfeed he had taken too much on himself as at some point he was effective the CEO, CTO, chief scientist, and chief product. Besides, in his words, the project lacked focus overall. Due to the many questions regarding function and design of decentralized collaborative platforms, during 18 months of work, Backfeed circled through 5 different products in search of the ultimate one that would materialize the vision and bring it into reality. Thus, it became clear that the team should stop and really specify the product it needs/wants to develop, before jumping again into further development.\n\nPayment and collaboration are currently being implemented through Genesis Alpha as a series of steps in the Alchemy project: \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/)\n\n\n“With Alchemy, hundreds, thousands, and perhaps someday, millions of people will be able to contribute to an efficient decision-making process for allocating funds.”\n\n\n“Alchemy offers a user-friendly interface from which thousands of people (or more) can coordinate towards a common purpose. Our plan to achieve this is by starting to “[Dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)” Alchemy ourselves and use it as the main interface to manage several pilots that will safely lead up to the creation of the Genesis DAO. Another path we are taking in achieving this goal is to release a set of features that will enable any group in the world to safely and easily create and manage their own DAO. We will continue to lower the adoption threshold by adding integrations with collaboration tools people are already using such as Telegram, Slack and other collaboration tools.”\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pv79ByTHRnFEAnLL2G-dATdxYUrk4vNgCCNlvsAPPsJaAQuYWM_Ho94HWOLPlN2IfmBEjkE4u79gdUb_oQNM02UcIvlJE1A60ej8lpXhYRphMyt3q7kWihDsq1hBZaEC7OJkAA502IQIozd7EilUR5YfHE2XwocVscL87SUWx0RE5dlk2SmLAmljtZY9)\n\n### [Foundups](https://www.foundups.com/)\n\nSince 2012 Michael Trout claims to be the actual inventor of blockchain and has been developing Open Value Frameworks with the aim to transform the broken startup world (97% of startups fail) into a foundups world in which innovation does not come to waste and ideas get recycled, rewarded and programmed into the blockchain.

This is a widespread and complex problem.  Yet, without making [[BestEfforts]] in an attempt to provide solutions for some people at least, no means to define a solution will be produced.  In this case, there is a broader ecosystem framework that is thought to provide a scaffolding framework to support the development of solutions to this, and many other problems.  However, as these works need to be done; and that there isn't possibly the means to find and structure,\n1. The means to formerally engage in a manner akin to contract and/or employment agreements all persons who may be able to contribute usefully in some way big or small; and that,\n2. the means to find all the money needed to pay everyone for work that they may or may not do well is not practically feasible; and that,\n3. Projects such as the [[ValueAccountingInitiatives]] (including [Slicing Pie](https://slicingpie.com/learn-slicing-pie-model/)) and in a different way GitHub (ie: The [DevDocs project](https://github.com/webizenai/devdocs/)) illustrate various parts of a broader solution that can be structured and made able to work; now therefore,\n\nPart of the underlying solution, requires a means to provide a 'fair value' for the work-effort of a person; which may thereafter be associated to a variety of other paramaters; such as,\n\n4. The licensing context (ie: exclusively provided?  or provided, and able to be used by other projects)\n5. The Location and use of  Purchasing Power Parity ( `#ppp` ) [see OECD example](https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm)\n6. The Context in which the work was done (ie: a requirement that was needed immediately or at some scheduled time; or something that was done on an unsolicited basis)\n7. The Context in which the work was either funded or sought to be subject to compensatory terms based upon the usefulness and/or successful employment of the works derivatives.\n\nThere are others; and this area is to be explored in a more fulsome way as the documentation develops.  \n\n### Australian Context\nWebCivics is currently being produced from Australia.  Therefore the modelling that i am best able to provide at the moment is through the lens of the Australian Context, and thereby using PPP Methods to adjust for foreign contexts.  The Australian Government has provided a [Minimum Wage Caculator](https://calculate.fairwork.gov.au/FindYourAward) which is helpful to produce a baseline framework.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/IntellectualPropertyAgreement/CC_BY-NC-4.0-License/","title":"CC BY-NC 4.0 License"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# CC BY-NC 4.0 License\n\n## Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)\n\nThis is a human-readable summary of (and not a substitute for) the [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode). [Disclaimer](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/#).\n\n### You are free to:\n\n-   **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\n-   **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material\n\n-   The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.\n\n---\n\n### Under the following terms:\n\n-   **Attribution** — You must give [appropriate credit](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/#), provide a link to the license, and [indicate if changes were made](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/#).

It is generally understood to mean that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired result, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result.\n\nIn contrast, behavior that is intentionally harmful, exploitative, or a willful breach of an agreement of fair dealings would involve a conscious choice to act in a way that is detrimental to others or that goes against the terms of an agreement. This type of behavior would not be considered to be making a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as it would be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions rather than a desire to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nTo expand on my interpretation, \"best efforts\" refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. This means that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired outcome, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result. This means that if something goes wrong or the desired result is not achieved, it is not necessarily a breach of the obligation as long as the person has made a good faith effort to achieve the result.\n\nIn contrast, mistakes that are made intentionally are different because they involve a conscious choice to act in a certain way, rather than being an unintentional or unforeseen outcome. Intentional mistakes are typically made with the knowledge that they are likely to result in a negative outcome, and may be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions. These mistakes would not be considered to be made in good faith or as a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as the person making the mistake is acting in a way that is not in line with the goal or purpose of the activity.\n\nSource: Chat.OpenAi.com"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/OurValues/CommunityOfPractice/","title":"Community of Practice"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Community of Practice\n\n### What is a 'Community of Practice'?\n\nA Community of Practice is defined in [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) in the following way;\n\nA **community of practice** (**CoP**) is a group of people who \"share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly\".[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#cite_note-1) The concept was first proposed by [cognitive anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_anthropology \"Cognitive anthropology\") [Jean Lave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lave \"Jean Lave\") and educational theorist [Etienne Wenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etienne_Wenger \"Etienne Wenger\") in their 1991 book _Situated Learning_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)). Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWenger1998)).\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)).\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunchroom at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFDub%C3%A9BourhisJacob2005)) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFSheridan2015)). A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFKietzmannPlanggerEatonHeilgenberg2013)) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pragmatism \"American pragmatism\"), especially [C. S. Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Peirce \"C. S. Peirce\")'s concept of the \"[community of inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_inquiry \"Community of inquiry\")\" ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFShields2003)), but also [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey \"John Dewey\")'s principle of learning through occupation ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWallace2007)).\n\nThe Concept of a ‘community of practice’ is considered to be more involved that simply having a ‘community standards’ statement or similar; that has historically been shown to be susceptible to be written or re-written, by project owners to most benefit those authors whilst mitigating risks due to wrongs that may have occurred; and/or, issues that the group leaders have no interest in addressing.\n\nOne of the areas of particular interest to me - is to support human rights; including, but not limited to, ensuring equitable treatment of people who contribute useful work, when it is found to be valuable; and to ensure ‘probity’ / support for human dignity; by seeking to protect against acts of ‘intellectual dishonesty’, such as re-writing someone's former work then displacing provenance; as is often motivated by simplified economic concepts employed by lay-people and/or bad actors. \n\nThe requirements to address these sorts of ‘community of practice’ considerations; do evolve, but must start somewhere - as is part of the consequence of my writing / doing this work; alongside my means to employ concepts / information - I'm aware of; that supports improved communications. \n\n`#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/OurValues/FairWorkProtocols/","title":"Fair Work Protocols"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Fair Work Protocols\n\nThe Development of Fair Work Protocols, is an essential component to producing any solution that has any capacity whatsoever for [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].\n\nThe Considerations relate to a problem that is fundamentally very old, and indeed also quite complex.  In consideration, a lens of considering the past - in particular, the 8 hour movement and related historical contexts are thought useful when considering how a means to address these sorts of complex problems, might be addressed. \n\n### About the 8-Hour Movement\nThe [8-hour movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day) was a labor movement that sought to improve working conditions and protect the rights of workers by advocating for the reduction of the workday to 8 hours. The movement emerged in the late 19th century, at a time when many workers were subjected to long and grueling workdays, often working 12 hours or more per day.\n\nThe 8-hour movement argued that reducing the workday to 8 hours would improve the health and well-being of workers, as well as increase productivity and efficiency. The movement used a variety of tactics to promote its goals, including strikes, boycotts, and lobbying efforts.\n\nThe 8-hour movement was successful in achieving many of its goals. In many countries, labor laws were enacted that set limits on the length of the workday and established the right to overtime pay for work beyond 8 hours per day. In the United States, the 8-hour movement played a key role in the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the 40-hour workweek and established the right to overtime pay for work beyond 40 hours per week.\n\nOverall, the 8-hour movement was a significant force in the fight for workers' rights and helped to improve the working conditions and well-being of millions of workers around the world.\n\nActivities that are a form of work are those that are performed for the purpose of earning a living or producing goods or services. These activities may involve physical or mental labor and may be performed for an employer or as self-employment. Examples of work activities include:\n\n1.  Manufacturing goods\n2.  Providing services, such as consulting or healthcare\n3.  Teaching or lecturing\n4.  Performing research\n5.  Writing or creating content\n6.  Sales or marketing\n7.  Managing a business\n\nWork activities are typically distinguished from recreation and sleep activities in that they are undertaken for the purpose of earning a living or producing goods or services, rather than for leisure or relaxation. However, it is important to note that what is considered work may vary depending on cultural and societal context, and some activities that are considered work in one context may be considered recreation in another.\n\nThe principles of the 8-hour movement, which sought to improve working conditions and protect the rights of workers in the industrial era, can be rejuvenated and applied to knowledge work in a number of ways. Some potential approaches could include:\n\n1.  Adjusting the focus: Rather than focusing solely on the number of hours worked, the principles of the 8-hour movement could be adapted to address issues specific to knowledge work, such as the need for flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance.\n    \n2.  Strengthening worker protections: Knowledge workers may not have the same level of legal protections as traditional workers, such as the right to unionize or the protection of labor laws. Policymakers and advocacy groups could work to strengthen protections for knowledge workers, such as by establishing new regulations or extending existing protections to cover this group.\n    \n3.  Promoting fair compensation: Knowledge work can often be highly skilled and specialized, and knowledge workers may be entitled to fair compensation for their contributions. Advocacy groups and policymakers could work to promote fair compensation for knowledge work, such as by establishing guidelines or standards for fair pay.\n    \n4.  Supporting education and training: The principles of the 8-hour movement could also be rejuvenated by supporting education and training programs that help knowledge workers to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their careers. This could include initiatives to promote lifelong learning and provide access to educational opportunities for knowledge workers.\n    \n\n### Forming an applied Methodology for Knowledge Workers\nThere are many ways that the principles of the 8-hour movement could be rejuvenated and applied to knowledge work in order to support the rights and well-being of knowledge workers. By adjusting the focus to address the specific needs of knowledge workers, strengthening worker protections, promoting fair compensation, and supporting education and training, it is possible to create a more supportive and fair environment for knowledge work. This can help to ensure that knowledge workers are able to contribute their skills and expertise to society, while also being able to enjoy a high quality of life and work-life balance.\n\nThe nature of the concept of time spent engaged in work, recreation, and sleep activities for knowledge workers may differ from that of traditional workers in a number of ways. Some potential differences could include:\n\n1.  Flexibility: Knowledge work often requires a high level of flexibility, as knowledge workers may need to be able to adapt to changing demands and priorities. This may involve working outside of traditional business hours or working from different locations.\n    \n2.  Autonomy: Knowledge workers may also have a higher level of autonomy, as they may be responsible for managing their own work schedules and priorities. This can allow for greater control over the balance between work, recreation, and sleep activities.\n    \n3.  Boundaries: The boundaries between work, recreation, and sleep may be less clear for knowledge workers, as they may be required to be available and responsive to work-related demands outside of traditional business hours. This can make it more difficult to maintain a healthy balance between these activities.\n    \n\nThe nature of the concept of time spent engaged in work, recreation, and sleep activities for knowledge workers may be more flexible and autonomous than for traditional workers, but it may also involve a greater challenge in maintaining a healthy balance between these activities.\n\nPaying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their time spent doing work is important for a number of reasons:\n\n1.  Fair compensation: Knowledge work can often be highly skilled and specialized, and knowledge workers may be entitled to fair compensation for their contributions. Paying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their work can help to ensure that they are fairly compensated for their efforts and expertise.\n    \n2.  Motivation and retention: Fair compensation can also be important for motivating and retaining knowledge workers. If knowledge workers feel that they are not being fairly compensated for their work, they may be less motivated to perform at their best or may be more likely to leave for other opportunities.\n    \n3.  Intellectual property rights: Payment can also help to respect the intellectual property rights of knowledge workers. If knowledge workers are not compensated for their useful works, they may not have the financial resources to enforce their intellectual property rights or may be less likely to assert their rights in the face of potential exploitation.\n    \n\n#### Building an Equitable Future for Creators\n\nPaying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their work is important for ensuring that they are fairly compensated, motivated, and able to assert their intellectual property rights. This can help to create a more supportive and fair environment for knowledge work, which can benefit both knowledge workers and society as a whole.\n\nIncome is often closely related to a person's ability to keep themselves safe, as having a steady and sufficient source of income can provide access to a range of resources and protections that can help to ensure safety and security.\n\nFor example, having a sufficient income can allow a person to afford basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medical care, which can help to ensure physical safety and well-being. Income can also provide access to financial resources that can be used to protect against financial risks, such as the ability to afford insurance or save for emergencies.\n\nIn addition, income can often be used to purchase goods and services that can help to ensure safety, such as security systems or emergency services. Having a sufficient income can also allow a person to afford legal representation or other forms of advocacy, which can be important for protecting their rights and interests.\n\nincome is often closely related to a person's ability to keep themselves safe, as it provides access to a range of resources and protections that can help to ensure safety and security.\n\n\n### Relationship to Web Science Tasks\n\nThere are a number of web science questions that could be investigated in order to support the development of fair work protocols for knowledge workers. Some potential areas of investigation could include:\n\n1.  Workflow and productivity: Web science research could explore how different workflows and technologies impact the productivity and well-being of knowledge workers. This could include studying the effects of remote work, flexible work schedules, and collaborative tools on worker outcomes.\n    \n2.  Fair compensation: Web science research could also examine how to design fair compensation systems for knowledge workers, including exploring the use of algorithms and other tools to assess the value of different types of knowledge work.\n    \n3.  Intellectual property rights: Web science research could also explore ways to protect the intellectual property rights of knowledge workers, including studying the effectiveness of different approaches to licensing and copyright.\n    \n4.  Work-life balance: Web science research could examine how to support work-life balance for knowledge workers, including studying the impact of different work environments and policies on worker well-being.\n    \n\nThere are many different web science questions that could be investigated in order to support the development of fair work protocols for knowledge workers. By studying these issues, web science can help to inform the design of policies and practices that support the rights and well-being of knowledge workers.\n\n### ESG Implications \n[[ESG]] (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria can be related to the importance of developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers in a number of ways. For example:\n\n1.  Social criteria: Developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers could be considered a social issue, as it relates to the well-being and rights of workers. Ensuring that knowledge workers are treated fairly and are able to work in a supportive and healthy environment could be seen as a key element of a company's social responsibility.\n    \n2.  Governance criteria: Fair work protocols can also be related to governance criteria, as they can help to ensure that a company is governed in a transparent and accountable manner. Developing and implementing fair work protocols can help to demonstrate a company's commitment to responsible and ethical business practices.\n    \n\nOverall, ESG criteria can be related to the importance of developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers in that they can help to ensure that companies are addressing key social and governance issues and are committed to responsible and ethical business practices. By considering ESG criteria in the development of fair work protocols, companies can help to ensure that they are contributing to a more sustainable and equitable society."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/OurValues/FitForPurpose/","title":"Fit For Purpose"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Fit For Purpose\n\n*Content produced quickly via ChatGPT*\n\n>*When designing tools that form part of an ecosystems solution that is implemented using software and socio-economic systems; how would you define a rule or condition that a useful component should be 'fit for purpose', define 'fit for purpose'..*\n\nThe term \"fit for purpose\" refers to the extent to which a product, service, or system is suitable or appropriate for the specific purpose or use for which it was designed. When designing tools as part of an ecosystem solution that is implemented using software and socio-economic systems, it is important to ensure that each component is \"fit for purpose\" in order to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of the overall solution.\n\nTo ensure that a component is \"fit for purpose,\" it is necessary to consider a number of different factors. These might include the specific requirements or needs of the users or stakeholders who will be interacting with the component, the technical capabilities and limitations of the component, and any regulatory or compliance requirements that must be met.\n\nOverall, a component is considered \"fit for purpose\" if it meets the specific needs and requirements of the users or stakeholders, and if it performs the functions it was designed to perform in an effective and efficient manner.\n\n\n> *What sorts of considerations should be made to evaluate whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular usecase?*\n\nThere are several considerations that should be made when evaluating whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular use case. Some of the key considerations might include:\n\n1.  The specific requirements or needs of the users or stakeholders: It is important to carefully consider the specific needs and requirements of the users or stakeholders who will be interacting with the solution. This might include factors such as the tasks they will be performing, the information they need to access, and any specific constraints or limitations they may face.\n    \n2.  The technical capabilities and limitations of the solution: It is also important to consider the technical capabilities and limitations of the solution, and to ensure that it is capable of performing the tasks it was designed to perform. This might include factors such as the performance, scalability, and reliability of the solution.\n    \n3.  Any regulatory or compliance requirements: Depending on the context in which the solution will be used, there may be certain regulatory or compliance requirements that must be met. It is important to carefully consider these requirements and to ensure that the solution is compliant.\n    \n4.  The cost and value of the solution: It is also important to consider the cost of the solution and to ensure that it provides good value for money. This might involve comparing the cost of the solution to the benefits it is expected to provide, and determining whether the benefits outweigh the costs.\n    \n\nOverall, these are just a few of the key considerations that should be made when evaluating whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular use case.\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/OurValues/SupportForHumanAgency/","title":"Support for Human Agency"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Support for Human Agency\n\nEngendering design modals / models, in a manner i broadly describe as 'Human Centric'; which may therefore also be described as Human Centric AI and Human Centric Web; denotes a significant shift in the design topology for how electronic and/or information communications infrastructure and related knowledge & AI systems, are designed and deployed.  This note is linked to the considerations made about [[GuardianshipRelations]] and in-turn the responsibility upon all who support [[ValuesCredentials]] to ensure our behaviour acts in a manner that assists us all to ensure that we are always [[ProtectingDependants]].\n\nAt the heart of this topology; in so far as it is being designed with the express intention to support, is a methodology that brings the human agent into the ownership structures as the first-class stakeholders.  To illustrate this, i have made a copy of some of the notes i have been producing about a seperate project that i call 'webizen'.  In this model; the effect of how HumanCentricAI is furnished to natural persons, and in-turn also groups, is by 'users' purchasing their 'webizen' as property, so taht they own it; and in-turn, become their own 'platform provider'.  Whilst other HumanCentricAI systems might find other ways to address difficult problems,  I will employ some of the considerations that i am making with Webizen, in-order to illustrate the general gist of the idea; and thereby provide support for insights.\n\n### Individuals\n\nThere are various complexities within this topic and those that in-turn depend upon it (ie: support for webizen agents that are 'owned' by an incorporated entity / legal personality (as distinct to natural legal person)); for now, this document seeks to discuss the considerations as they relate to individuals.\n\nThe Diagram Below make an attempt to describe the elements involved. \n\n![[webizen_diagram_1-2.jpg]]\n\n**Description of Diagram Concepts:**\nIn the above diagram; there is a Webizen Agent, which is the tooling used to power the ecosystem; this is in-turn plugged into a web-server, that is connected via tailscale to a public point of presence, that is required to support domain-name resolution (DNS).  \n\nThe consideration becomes; that perhaps there are effectively two seperate databases, one that is a persons ***'personal vault' database***, which is owned by them and contains the resources that have not been provided to anyone else.  Whilst the personal-vault database can be stored on multiple devices, and may contain different amounts of the overall data-volume on each device - this database is owned by the 'webizen owner'...  \n\nSeperately, is the ***permissive commons database***, which contains data that has electronic contracts associated to its use & modification, is in-effect a commons system; that is stored in a decentralised manner in-order to support various processing and networking related functional requirements.   The contents held in the webizen network providers permissive commons environment may be substantially different to the contents held by a webizen owner; although, any content that is permissively able to be shared with either may be.\n\n***NOTE:** Permissive Commons is another Web Civics Project.  It is intended to produce decentralised multi-protocol supported systems, that radically uplift how we manage 'commons'; therein also noting, [[WhatAreTheCommons]] defines the intended meaning.*\n\n### Families\n\nBy extension, the design concept might be that each competent natural legal person has their own webizen 'private vault'; and that resources relating to the union of persons, thereby end-up being a form of highly-encrypted resource that's stored in the permissive commons technology ecosystem; with the exception of the systems / records, relating to other human beings, such as children or others whom someone has a relationship of legal and/or medical guardianship... \n\n#### Guardianship Semantics\n\nThis in-turn is intended to provide support for users to employ the webizen related infrastructure as an entity who has individual rights, responsibilities and capacities as an natural legal person to thereby engage with others; form contracts, including those that relate to shared rights as defined via electronic agreements (ie: permissive commons technology related - shared rights / responsibilities).   In these systems; that in-turn provide support for various currencies and in-turn [[KnowledgeWork]] or moreover the ability for people to contribute irraspective of historical considerations about employment status.\n\nTherein; the underlying principal being in consideration of the moral virtues to consider;\n\n*All persons to be entitled to contribute & be acknowledge as a contributor, rather than simply defined as a consumer, whose useful works as are often a form of [[IntellectualPropertyAgreement/IntellectualProperty]] must necessarily be subject to [[FalseAttribution]] and in-turn the person subjected to other wrongs.*\n\nTherein and consequentially thereafter; General issues that need to be attended to...  \n\n1.

Values credentials are a type of [VerifiableClaims&Credentials](VerifiableClaims&Credentials.md).\n\nThe term 'values' is intended to denote the concept of a persons (human being or guardian) 'human values' that need to be provided the apparatus to provide support for those values.\n\nThese tools, are considered to be of instrumental importance for the development of webizen as 'peace infrastructure' both as a project, and as a toolset for the production of other projects.\n\nThe Values Credentials, provide support for how other agents are able to be managed.  Rather than the concept of 'opt-in' or 'consent', the concept of 'values credentials' relates to 'human agency', and the ability and desirability for human beings as foundationally important active natural agents, to make wilful choices about how it is they want to organise their life; and in-turn also, how it is they're able to track and improve their own quality of being, and the growth of themselves as a person.  \n\nUsers are able to use values credentials, to help them curate how they interact with other agents; and can even provide support for excluding themselves from other agents who do not share some particular common-value that is of great importance to that person / agent.\n\nImportantly also, these systems are designed to support [[SocialFactors]] ,

exist.  The future [[TheValuesProject]] outcome is prodominately designed to provide the software required for people to more respectfully engage in contracts with others online directly between one another; and in-turn, they are also able to vary their agreements and make their own independent decisions about what to do in circumstances where values have been breached.  To enable these systems, more work needs to be done during this development stage.  As such, the ability to engender agency for persons in a manner that is considered [[FitForPurpose]] is not able to be better achieved until the technology that furnishes the means to do so, has been successfully accumplished. As such, the notes about the present-development stage is of instrumental importance until it is otherwise declared.\n\n#### The present development stage\n\n[[TemporalSemantics]] are kinda useful, so i'll make a note as of the time that i am now therefore writing this note. These notes will be updated overtime, and the information will be supplimented rather than replaced - save exceptional circumstances, etc.\n\n##### 3rd Feb 2023: notes\n\nPursuant to the notes made in the [[GuideForDevelopers]] and related [[WebizenTerms]] which is now therefore being developed primarily to support the [[WebizenDiscord]] channel; where there are conflicting values that are otherwise noted in one or more of the values related instruments noted above; a degree of [[BestEfforts]] to form a common-sense opinion / position, is overwhelmingly considered desirable.  IF persons are unable to bind themselves to the general concepts that are emboided in these instruments, then do not get involved.  Persons who are known to have wilfully acted in a manner that has sought to commit wrongs such as those described by the notes on [[SocialAttackVectors]] may be subject to [[banishmentExile]] without notice and without further regard, irraspective of employer or any other factor that may otherwise discriminatorily fail to adhere to the foundational principals described in the instruments above.  \n\n#### Once webizen systems are operational.\n\n### Arbitration of conflicting values.\n\nThe arbitration of matters involving alledged wrongs will be processed in accordance with the [[WebizenTerms]] stipulations; until such time as [[TheWebizenCharter]] and corralated [[WebizenAlliance]] infrastructure is able to be established; which in-turn requires a functional [[WebizenTechStack]] implementation, which is the purposeful activity that gives rise to the purpose of having written this and other notes here. \n\n[[BestEfforts]] are to be undertaken at all times, however, all rights are reserved.\n\n`#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/CriminalActivity/","title":"Criminal Activity"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Criminal Activity\n\n## Summary\nMost Social Attack Vectors actually relate to the performance of criminal activities.  \n\nHere are some examples;\n- [[CorporateCrime]]\n- [[CyberCrime]]\n- [[FinancialCrimes]]\n- [[Fraud]]\n\nand whilst the activity may or may not necessarily be criminal in nature or consequence, the underlying experience i've been made very much aware of; is the consequential ability for persons to thereafter be rendered gainful support via [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]] that can have the effect of all parties involved somewhat jointly seeking to ensure lawful remedy is not made available to the victim of any such forms of attacks, regardless of the consequences put upon that person and/or others relating to them.  These sorts of problems are in-fact very serious and need to be addressed as a matter of priority; particularly, in relation to behaviours that have serious negative implications and/or impacts upon children, and particularly therein - those that relate to the behaviours of adults that target children.\n\n\n*ChatGPT:*\n\nIn order for a person to be found guilty of committing a crime, the prosecution must be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person committed the crime as defined by law. This typically requires the prosecution to present evidence that demonstrates the elements of the crime, such as the act or conduct that constituted the crime, the intent or state of mind of the accused, and any attendant circumstances.\n\nIn criminal cases, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. This means that the prosecution must present evidence that is sufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence and to persuade the jury or judge that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIf the prosecution is able to meet this burden of proof, the accused may be found guilty of the crime. If the prosecution is unable to meet this burden of proof, the accused may be found not guilty or the case may be dismissed.\n\nOverall, the legal standard for finding someone guilty of a crime is high, and it is designed to ensure that individuals are not wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit.\n\nThere are several procedural requirements that must be followed in order to address an issue of criminal wrongdoing online, particularly if the account being used is not easily associated with the legal person using it. Some of the key steps that may be involved in this process include:\n\n1.  Investigation: The first step in addressing an issue of criminal wrongdoing online is typically to conduct an investigation. This may involve collecting and analyzing evidence, such as electronic records and documents, to determine the nature and extent of the wrongdoing.\n    \n2.  Identification of suspects: If the investigation reveals that a crime has been committed, the next step is typically to identify the suspects involved. This may involve using forensic techniques to trace the IP address of the account being used or to identify any other identifying information that may be associated with the account.\n    \n3.  Arrest and charging: If the suspects are identified and there is sufficient evidence to support charges, the next step is typically to arrest the suspects and charge them with the appropriate crimes.\n    \n4.  Pre-trial proceedings: Once the suspects have been charged, the case will typically proceed to pre-trial proceedings, which may include plea negotiations, motions, and other legal proceedings.\n    \n5.  Trial: If the case is not resolved through pre-trial proceedings, it will typically proceed to trial, where the prosecution will present its case and the defense will present its case.\n    \n6.  Verdict and sentencing: If the suspects are found guilty, the court will typically impose a sentence, which may include imprisonment, fines, or other penalties.\n    \n\nOverall, the process of addressing an issue of criminal wrongdoing online can be complex and time-consuming, and it requires the involvement of law enforcement agencies and legal professionals. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the risks of criminal activity online and to take steps to prevent and detect it."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/CyberAttackVectors/","title":"Cyber Attack Vectors"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Cyber Attack Vectors\n\nWhilst un-developed as yet; a consideration has been made that it may be appropriate to create a category that is seperate from the [[SocialAttackVectors]] to address risks that more specifically relate to Cyber, although, the two areas are in-turn linked.

While criminal law aims to punish individuals who commit crimes, tort law aims to compensate individuals who suffer harm as a result of the actions of others.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-:2-2)[a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-4) Some wrongful acts, such as [assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault \"Assault\") and [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime) \"Battery (crime)\"), can result in both a civil lawsuit and a criminal prosecution in countries where the civil and criminal legal systems are separate. Tort law may also be contrasted with [contract law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_law \"Contract law\"), which provides civil remedies after breach of a duty that arises from a contract. Obligations in both tort and criminal law are more fundamental and are imposed regardless of whether the parties have a contract.\n\nWhile tort law in [civil law jurisdictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system) \"Civil law (legal system)\") largely derives from [Roman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law \"Roman law\"), [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") jurisdictions derive their tort law from customary [English tort law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_tort_law \"English tort law\"). In civil law jurisdictions based on civil codes, both contractual and tortious or delictual liability is typically outlined in a civil code based on Roman Law principles. Tort law is referred to as the law of delict in [Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law \"Scots law\") and [Roman Dutch law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman-Dutch_law \"Roman-Dutch law\"), and resembles tort law in common law jurisdictions in that rules regarding civil liability are established primarily by precedent and theory rather than an exhaustive code. However, like other civil law jurisdictions, the underlying principles are drawn from Roman law. A handful of jurisdictions have codified a mixture of common and civil law jurisprudence either due to their colonial past (e.g. Québec, St Lucia, Mauritius) or due to influence from multiple legal traditions when their civil codes were drafted (e.g. Mainland China, the Philippines, and Thailand). Furthermore, Israel essentially codifies common law provisions on tort.\n\n\n## Outline of tort law\n\n[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_tort_law)\n\nThe following [outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list) \"Outline (list)\") is provided as an overview of and introduction to tort law in [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") jurisdictions:\n\n**[Tort law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_law \"Tort law\")** – defines what a legal injury is and, therefore, whether a person may be held liable for an injury they have caused. Legal injuries are not limited to physical injuries. They may also include emotional, economic, or reputational injuries as well as violations of privacy, property, or constitutional rights.\n\n### Torts against the person\n\n[Torts (trespass) against the person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_against_the_person \"Trespass against the person\") – category of torts that describes a civil wrong that causes physical harm to the complainant:\n\n-   [Assault (tort)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_(tort) \"Assault (tort)\") – intentionally and voluntarily causing the reasonable apprehension of an immediate harmful or offensive contact.\n-   [Battery (tort)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(tort) \"Battery (tort)\") – Bringing about an unconsentful harmful or offensive contact with a person or to something closely associated with that person (such as an item of clothing). It differs from assault in that it requires actual contact.\n-   [False imprisonment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment \"False imprisonment\") – A person is intentionally confined without legal authority.\n-   [Intentional infliction of emotional distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress \"Intentional infliction of emotional distress\") – Intentional conduct that results in extreme emotional distress.\n\n### Negligent torts\n\n[Negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence \"Negligence\") – failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances\n\n-   [Breach of duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence#Breach_of_duty \"Negligence\") – There can be no liability in negligence unless the claimant established that he or she was owed a [duty of care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care \"Duty of care\") by the defendant and that there has been a breach of that duty.\n-   [Legal causation or remoteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence#Legal_causation_or_remoteness \"Negligence\") – The idea that liability may be so remote from the defendant that the negligence was not foreseeable or preventable by that party.\n-   [Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligent_infliction_of_emotional_distress \"Negligent infliction of emotional distress\") - The idea that one has a [legal duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care \"Duty of care\") to use reasonable care to avoid causing [emotional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion \"Emotion\") [distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(medicine) \"Stress (medicine)\") to another individual.\n-   [Malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpractice \"Malpractice\") or [professional negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_negligence \"Professional negligence\") – Negligence in the provision of a professional service causing harm to the claimant. Common varieties include [medical malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice \"Medical malpractice\") and [legal malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_malpractice \"Legal malpractice\")\n-   [Negligence _per se_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence_per_se \"Negligence per se\") – Conduct which by its very nature gives rise to a presumption of negligence.\n\n### Property torts\n\n-   [Trespass to land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_to_land \"Trespass to land\") – Committed when an individual intentionally enters the land of another without lawful excuse. It is actionable _per se_, and thus the party whose land was entered may sue even if no actual harm is done.\n-   [Trespass to chattels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels \"Trespass to chattels\") – Committed when an individual intentionally interferes with the personal property of another. Slight deprivation, like briefly placing a hand on someone else's car, is not actionable.\n-   [Conversion (law)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(law) \"Conversion (law)\") – An intentional tort to personal property where the defendant's willful interference with the chattel deprives plaintiff of the possession of the same.\n-   [Nuisance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuisance \"Nuisance\") – Denial of quiet enjoyment to owners of [real property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_property \"Real property\"). A private nuisance is an unreasonable, unwarranted, or unlawful interference with another person's private use and enjoyment of his or her property; whereas a public nuisance is an interference with the rights of the public generally. The test to determine whether an interference is reasonable is whether the gravity of the harm is outweighed by the social benefit of the nuisance.\n\n### Dignitary torts\n\n[Dignitary torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignitary_torts \"Dignitary torts\") – a specific category of intentional torts where the cause of action is being subjected to certain kinds of indignities.\n\n-   [Defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation \"Defamation\") – The communication of a statement that makes a false claim, expressively stated or implied to be factual, that may harm the reputation of an entity.\n    -   [Libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libel \"Libel\") – Written defamation\n    -   [Slander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slander \"Slander\") – Spoken defamation\n    -   [False light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_light \"False light\") – A tort unique to American jurisprudence which covers defamatory statements which, although true, can give rise to false negative perceptions of the claimant.\n-   [Invasion of privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_privacy \"Invasion of privacy\") – The unlawful intrusion into the personal life of another person without just cause.\n-   [Breach of confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_confidence \"Breach of confidence\") – Protects private information conveyed in confidence; typically requires that the information be of a confidential nature, communicated in confidence, and was disclosed to the detriment of the claimant.\n-   [Abuse of process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_process \"Abuse of process\") – A malicious and deliberate misuse or perversion of regularly issued court process not justified by the underlying legal action.\n-   [Malicious prosecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_prosecution \"Malicious prosecution\") – Similar to [abuse of process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_process \"Abuse of process\"), but includes intent, pursuing without probable cause, and dismissal in favor of the victim. In some jurisdictions, _malicious prosecution_ is reserved for the wrongful initiation of criminal proceedings, while _malicious use of process_ refers to the wrongful initiation of civil proceedings.\n-   [Alienation of affections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affections \"Alienation of affections\") – Brought by a spouse against a third party, whom the spouse believes has interfered with his or her marriage. There is no requirement that all affections in the marriage be destroyed, only that there has been some diminution in the love and affection between the married couple.\n\n### Economic torts\n\n[Economic torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_torts \"Economic torts\") – torts that provide the common law rules on liability which arise out of business transactions such as interference with economic or business relationships and are likely to involve pure economic loss. Also called business torts.\n\n-   [Fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud \"Fraud\") – Making of a false representation by one party with an intention to induce another party into an act of commission or omission owing to which the later party suffers a damage. The first Party may or may not be the benefited by the damage caused to second party. Also, the first party need not be in collusion with someone who actually benefited.\n-   [Tortious interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference \"Tortious interference\") – One person intentionally damages the plaintiff's contractual or other business relationships.\n-   [Conspiracy (civil)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(civil) \"Conspiracy (civil)\") – An agreement between two or more parties to deprive a third party of legal rights or deceive a third party to obtain an illegal objective.\n-   [Restraint of trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraint_of_trade \"Restraint of trade\") – Contractual obligations not to trade are illegal agreements on public policy grounds unless they are reasonable in the interests concerning both parties and the public at large; this mainly affects post-termination restrictive covenants in employment contracts.\n-   [Passing off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_off \"Passing off\") – The tort of selling goods or services in a manner that falsely causes customers to believe they originate from a different brand or supplier.\n\n### Strict and absolute liability torts\n\nFurther information: [Strict liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_liability \"Strict liability\") and [Absolute liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_liability \"Absolute liability\")\n\n-   [Product liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_liability \"Product liability\") – The area of law in which products manufacturers, distributors and sellers are held responsible for the injuries caused by their products. Generally, a product liability claim is based on either a design defect, a manufacturing defect, or a failure to warn. This topic is closely associated with [negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence \"Negligence\"), [breach of warranty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_warranty \"Breach of warranty\") and [consumer protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection \"Consumer protection\").\n-   [Ultrahazardous activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrahazardous_activity \"Ultrahazardous activity\") – An activity so dangerous that a person engaged in such an activity can be held strictly liable for injuries caused to another person, regardless of whether or not reasonable precautions were taken to prevent others from being injured.\n-   [Absolute liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_liability \"Absolute liability\") – The rule in [M. C. Mehta v. Union of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Mehta_v._Union_of_India \"M. C. Mehta v. Union of India\"), in Indian tort law is a unique outgrowth of the doctrine of [strict liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_liability \"Strict liability\") for [ultrahazardous activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrahazardous_activity \"Ultrahazardous activity\"). Under this principle of absolute liability, an enterprise is absolutely liable without exceptions to compensate everyone affected by any accident resulting from the operation of hazardous activity.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_tort_law#cite_note-1)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/discriminationBasedAttacks/","title":"Discrimination based attacks."},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Discrimination based attacks.\n\n***NOTE:  below text is generated by ChatGPT***\n\nDiscrimination refers to the unequal treatment of individuals or groups based on certain characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, or ability. Discrimination can take many different forms, including:\n\n-   Direct discrimination: This occurs when a person is treated less favorably because of a specific characteristic, such as their race or religion.\n    \n-   Indirect discrimination: This occurs when a seemingly neutral policy or practice has a disproportionate impact on a particular group, such as a requirement for physical dexterity that disproportionately affects people with disabilities.\n    \n-   Harassment: This occurs when someone is subjected to unwanted and offensive behavior, such as comments or gestures, that are related to their race, religion, gender, etc.\n    \n-   Victimization: This occurs when a person is subjected to adverse treatment because they have made a complaint about discrimination or supported someone else who has made a complaint.\n    \n\nPeople with disabilities are one group that can experience discrimination. For example, they may face barriers in accessing education, employment, and other areas of life due to physical, attitudinal, and systemic barriers.\n\nDiscrimination is contrary to the principles of equality and human dignity, and it is prohibited by many human rights charters, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These charters establish that everyone is entitled to the same rights and freedoms, regardless of their race, religion, gender, etc.\n\n## Unintended Consequences.\n\nIt's important to recognize that not all instances of discrimination are intentional or malicious. In many cases, people may not be aware that their behavior is discriminatory, or they may have unconsciously internalized discriminatory attitudes and biases. This can be especially true when there are differences in cultural backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nFor example, in cross-cultural situations, misunderstandings can arise from differences in nonverbal communication, social norms, and cultural values. For instance, a gesture or phrase that is considered friendly in one culture may be perceived as disrespectful in another. In such cases, it is important to approach these differences with openness, respect, and a willingness to learn from one another.\n\nTo address these situations, it's important to provide education and awareness-raising about discrimination, cultural diversity, and the importance of treating everyone with respect. This can include:\n\n-   Providing training and resources on cultural sensitivity, cultural competence, and the harmful effects of discrimination.\n-   Encouraging open and respectful dialogue and communication, and providing opportunities for people to learn about and understand different cultural perspectives.\n-   Promoting a culture of inclusiveness, where everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of their background or cultural differences.\n-   Encouraging the reporting of incidents of discriminatory behavior, and providing support and resources for individuals who have experienced discrimination.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can help to create an online community where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their cultural background. This can help to promote greater understanding, cooperation, and a more peaceful and inclusive online community."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/LinkedInArticles/AI&SoftwareAgentsSocial-Engineering Considerations/","title":"AI & Software Agents: Social-Engineering Considerations"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# AI & Software Agents: Social-Engineering Considerations\n\nAugust 17, 2015\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-software-agents-social-engineering-considerations-timothy-holborn/\n\nHow do people consider the changes to their facebook feed and whether or how they may appear to be dynamic.  \n\nIs it possible that Graph functionality embedded within existing silos, may result in unintended consequences.  \n  \nI'll use Facebook as an example in this instances, whilst the intention is not to specifically pick on that company as the problem is bigger than the example provided...\n\nARCHITECTURE - FACEBOOK\n\nFacebook is a Social Networking Silo. the platform is provided freely, and the penetration rate of Facebook is [quite high](http://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), at 1.49 billion active users.\n\nFacebook enables communications between social-relationships via various means, including multi-media sharing, instant messaging, group-tools such as event listings, single-sign on products for other software providers to use FB as an authentication tool and therein share data about users, etc.\n\nFacebook makes money out of advertising and some of the most significant growth of facebook has related to the capacity for brands, apps and/or companies to integrate with facebook as a fast and simple way to extend reach and social-growth or promotions.\n\nThis is achieved through the use of [graph technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph)\n\nThe quick explanation is that the Facebook graph includes the ability to \"get\", \"post\" or \"delete\" an array of information such as;: user_birthday, user_religion_politics, user_relationships, user_relationship_details, user_hometown, user_location, user_likes, user_activities, user_education_history, user_work_history, user_website, user_managed_groups, user_events, user_photos, user_videos, user_photo_video_tags, user_friends, user_about_me, user_status, user_games_activity, user_tagged_places, user_posts, read_page_mailboxes, publish_checkins, status_update, photo_upload, video_upload, rsvp_event, email, create_note, share_item, publish_stream, ads_management, ads_read, read_insights, manage_pages, publish_pages, publish_actions, read_friendlists, user_actions.books, user_actions.music, user_actions.video, user_actions.news, user_actions.fitness, public_profile, basic_info\n\nThe more complex answer can be found in the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer), where once an OAUTH link has been established, permission granted - the amount of information that can be retrieved via a GET Command about a person and their activities enhances significantly.\n\nYet, this is not where the complications end-up.\n\nSome of the most promenade pages or applications that use Facebook authentication, also have their own websites. SO, they may distribute images or news-stories on FB, and then get traffic to their own sites.\n\nIn-turn, these links can be associated to external databases that may interact with, store and on the basis of acquired information - generate new POST requests, in relation to user-data.\n\nIn the land of Facebook, this functionality appears to be called an Audience Management API that interacts with a [CRM](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences-api)\n\nWhilst the capability to provide an [opt_out_link](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/custom-audience-targeting/v2.4) is provided by the specification, it is not a requirement.\n\nTHE USE OF SEMANTIC ANALYSIS When considering the data that is available to these services, it is not simply data that originated as text; but also, sensor data (such as temp. gps, et.al) and the transference of information that was sourced from objects depicted in photos, videos or audio, through to its utility and availability as [Structured Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model).\n\nThis in-turn compounds the amount of available data, for use by the before mentioned systems...\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe amount of information collected by these systems, and the results fed into the lives of individuals, is impacted by a dynamic, programmatic, AI, that includes both the algorithmic settings of Facebook itself, in addition to the interface capabilities and the way those capabilities are used by other (Facebook) users.\n\nWhilst the broader implications of what this capability does is unknown, as it would seemingly be reasonable to suggest that the study of awareness of these systems and/or any form of legal consideration around its possible impacts\n\nThe role of Software Agents or AI, impacts markets already. These systems are in-turn supported by agreements made pursuant to the terms of service, in this case, facebooks [terms of service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) which may be amended subject to the same agreement.\n\nYet, it seems the understandings of how these systems relate to what individual choices are, how concepts such as 'online bullying' may relate to software agents and how these engineered systems influence online participation and the future notions of privacy, data-rights or is it something else...\n\nWell, it seemed like something that could be better discussed and/or prototyped in-terms of presenting how these systems interact with data, and how AI systems may result in social consequences, intended or otherwise."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/LinkedInArticles/LinkedInLabellingAiAgents/","title":"Knowledge & Agent Labelling: Clear Labelling of AI Interactions & some ideas about how to test students, by AI."},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Knowledge & Agent Labelling: Clear Labelling of AI Interactions & some ideas about how to test students, by AI.\n\n***Below is an article i published on linkedin about the importance of labelling the contributions of Ai (software) agents.  The concepts illustrated in this document will end-up informing an approach that will become part of the safety protocols related solutions***\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/knowledge-agent-labelling-clear-ai-interactions-some-ideas-holborn/\n\nIn this quickly crafted article, i'm looking to quickly illustrate some considerations about the importance of labelling and/or provonance agent-relations to distinguish AI from Legal Entities (companies, etc) and fundamentally therein - human beings; and then, i've generated a few quick notes about possible ways to determine whether or not a student, understands a topic that they may otherwise simply use AI to generate reports (notwithstanding historical issue with plagiarism and the apparent 'lack of desire' to more properly employ plagiarism detectors).\n\nThe circumstances relating to these notes are different to the context of my notes in my DRAFT Webizen DevDocs; such as those about,\n\n-   [HumanCentric Digital Identity](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/WebScience/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricDigitalIdentity/)\n-   [Human Centric AI](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/WebScience/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI/)\n-   [centricity](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/WebScience/Centricity/)\n-   [Human-Centric AI Ethics](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/WebScience/HumanCentricAIEthics/)\n\n_(Noting - these documents are works in progress - some historical docs can be found_ _[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lV-Ruj9Gehwvs7B3wDLd6fmKIIvCmOqt)_ _as is part of_ _[the broader catalogue of documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tYFIggw8MIY5fD2u-nbwFRM6wqrhdmQZ)__)_\n\nAs these alternative ecosystems that i've been working to develop over many years, change the broad-ranging nature of how information-management systems are made to work; and therefore also, how solutions can be engineered to adddress problems in ways that cannot otherwise be achieved.\n\n---\n\nIn my Opinion (IMO); It is important that there is a clear means to distinguish between the content, information or processes and decisions that are made by Software Agents (AI) Vs. those made by legal entities; and in-turn also, the ability to dertermine which specific human beings were involved in many or causing any sort of causality related action to occur.\n\nThis opinion is unlikely to be shared by all persons, particularly those who would seek to pass-off the work of an AI Agent as their own works; without distinguishing what it is they did (as a human being) vs. what was done by an AI Agent. This problem is in-effect an extension of broader exhibits of similar behaviours where it is often sought to be accepted that an incorporated entity (ie: company/corporation, government department / agency, etc.) did something; without any meaningful way to determine which human beings specifically were responsible for whatever actions may have been made, that led to negative consequences upon others. Indeed also, these sorts of problems do not appear to be so much of a problem when the outcome is positive; unless, the outcome is wrongly positive for the target or beneficiary, of a costly mistake that may have been made by any such organisation.\n\nGiven the difficulties and in-turn attacks that occur as a consequence of raising these sorts of difficult issues / topics, that have enormous consequential implications, i've asked ChatAI to give me its point of view of these sorts of issues...\n\n> My Question:\n\n> What are the sorts of dangers, threats and social attack vectors that may occur if human beings are falsely led to believe they are consuming the work of other human beings or legal entities; when in-fact they're consuming information generated via an artificial intelligence software program?\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\n_There are several dangers and threats that may occur if individuals are falsely led to believe that they are consuming information generated by other human beings or legal entities when it is actually generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) program. Some of these include:_\n\n_-  Misinformation and disinformation: AI-generated content can be used to spread false or misleading information, which can have negative effects on individuals and society at large._ \n\n_-  Manipulation and influence: AI-generated content can be used to manipulate individuals and groups by appealing to their emotions, biases, and prejudices._\n\n_-  Privacy and security concerns: AI-generated content can be used to target individuals with personalized phishing, scams, and other malicious attacks._\n\n_-  Dehumanization and mistrust: People being exposed to AI generated content that is falsely presented as being generated by human could lead to mistrust in human-generated content, leading towards a dehumanization of human expression as well as a mistrust in human-generated content, AI-generated content can be used to perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce societal biases._\n\n_-  Interfere with legal process: AI-generated content can be used to impersonate people or entities for fraudulent activities or illegal activities and could interfere with legal proceedings._\n\n_Overall, it is important for individuals to be able to distinguish between AI-generated content and human-generated content in order to make informed decisions and to protect themselves from potential dangers._\n\n_Another potential danger of falsely believing that information is generated by human beings when it is actually generated by AI is that it may lead to a lack of critical thinking and evaluation of the information being consumed. If people believe that the information they are consuming is coming from a trusted source, they may be less likely to fact-check or critically evaluate it. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, as well as a decrease in people's ability to make well-informed decisions._\n\n_Additionally, there may be ethical concerns associated with the use of AI-generated content, particularly when it is used to impersonate human beings or legal entities. The ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-generated content raises questions about consent and accountability, as well as potential harms that may be caused by the use of this technology._\n\n_Finally, the widespread use of AI-generated content has the potential to disrupt various industries and change the way people think about and interact with information. It could change how professional authors, journalists, and creative professionals work, which could have both positive and negative impacts on the economy and society._\n\n> My Question: \n\n> What are some of the threats related to circumstances where government departments and/or employees may use Artificial Intelligence to act in a manner that has human rights implications in relation to the effect of those actions if it is not clearly labelled to have been done via an AI Agent?\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\n_If government departments or employees use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a way that has human rights implications and it is not clearly labeled as having been done by an AI agent, there could be several threats. Some of these include:_\n\n_-  Discrimination and bias: If an AI system is not transparent in its decision-making processes, it may perpetuate discrimination and bias against certain individuals or groups, potentially violating their human rights._\n\n_-  Lack of accountability: If an AI system is used to make decisions or take actions that have human rights implications, it can be difficult to hold individuals or organizations accountable if the system is not clearly labeled as an AI agent and its decision-making process is opaque._   \n\n_-  Due process concerns: If an AI system is used to make decisions that affect an individual's rights or freedoms, it may not always provide the same level of due process protections as a human decision-maker. This could lead to violations of human rights and the rule of law._\n\n_-  Privacy and security: If an AI system is used to process personal data without proper regulation or oversight, it could lead to privacy violations, security breaches, and other harms._\n\n_-  Lack of transparency: If the actions of an AI agent is not clearly labeled, it can make it difficult for people to understand how decisions are being made, which could lead to mistrust and lack of transparency._ \n\n_-  Interference with human autonomy: If an AI agent make decisions that have significant impact on human life, people may lose their autonomy on the decision making process and their right to self-determination._\n\n_Overall, it is crucial that government departments and employees are transparent in their use of AI, clearly label any decisions or actions that are made by an AI agent, and ensure that the AI systems they use are fair, accountable, and respect human rights._\n\n_Another potential threat is that the AI may have unintended consequences on human rights, if it not properly implemented, tested, and monitored. Even if the AI system is not inherently biased, the data it is trained on may be biased, leading to unjust outcomes._\n\n_Additionally, if the use of AI is not transparent and the decision-making processes of the AI system are not explainable, it may be difficult for people to understand how the decisions are being made and to challenge them if they believe that their human rights are being violated._\n\n_Moreover, if AI agents are used in law enforcement or security, without proper oversight or regulation, there could be a risk that the AI systems may be used to infringe on individuals’ rights, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, or to target certain groups based on their ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs._\n\n_It is important that the use of AI by government departments and employees is subject to proper regulation and oversight, so that human rights are protected and that the actions of the AI systems can be transparently tracked and audited._\n\n_Finally, It is crucial that the AI system are continuously monitored and evaluated for their impacts on human rights and adjustments or replacements are made if necessary._\n\n> My Question:\n\n> what are some of the potential risks in circumstances relating to foreign governments? \n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\n_There are several potential risks in circumstances related to foreign governments using AI:_\n\n_-  Cyber espionage: Foreign governments may use AI to conduct cyber espionage or cyberattacks against other countries, potentially stealing sensitive information or disrupting critical infrastructure._\n\n_-  Misinformation and disinformation: Foreign governments may use AI-generated content to spread false or misleading information, with the intention of manipulating public opinion or undermining the credibility of other governments._\n\n_-  Interference in domestic politics: Foreign governments may use AI to interfere in the domestic politics of other countries, with the goal of swaying elections or influencing policy decisions._\n\n_-  Economic espionage: Foreign governments may use AI to gain an unfair advantage in international trade, by collecting business intelligence and targeting specific industries or companies._\n\n_-  Military advantage: Foreign governments may use AI to enhance their military capabilities, potentially threatening the stability of regions and global security_\n\n_-  Human Rights abuse: AI technology has been used by some governments to track and control their citizens, violating their privacy and freedom. This technology can also be used to identify and monitor individuals based on their ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs, leading to further human rights violations._\n\n_Overall, the use of AI by foreign governments has the potential to destabilize international relations and threaten the security and sovereignty of other countries. It is important for governments to be aware of these risks and to take steps to protect against them, through international cooperation, regulation, and diplomacy._\n\n_Another potential risk is that foreign governments may use AI in a way that violates international law or human rights. For example, they may use AI-enabled surveillance to target political opponents, or use autonomous weapons to target civilians in warfare. These actions can have significant negative consequences on human rights and global security._\n\n_Moreover, the increasing use of AI in economic and technological fields may lead to a power imbalance between countries that have access to advanced AI technology and those that do not, leading to further economic and societal inequality._\n\n_Furthermore, if AI is not controlled and regulated properly, foreign governments may use it to violate international norms, such as economic sanctions or arms control agreements._\n\n_Lastly, foreign governments may also use AI to target individuals, companies or countries with cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns for political, economic, or military gain._\n\n_To mitigate these risks, it is crucial for countries to work together through international organizations and agreements to establish norms and regulations for the responsible development and use of AI, as well as to cooperate on matters of cyber security, disinformation, and human rights._\n\n> My Question:\n\n> What are some of the ways AI content and/or software actions could be clearly labelled and associated with the legal entity involved and responsible for that AI content and/or software action, including both any legal personality (ie: government department, institution, corporation or business, ) as well as the specific natural legal entities / individuals (human beings) who were instrumentally involved in enabling or rendering the applied use of AI for the particular artifact or event?\n\n_ChatGPT Answer;_\n\n_There are several ways that AI content and/or software actions can be clearly labeled and associated with the legal entity responsible for them, including both the legal personality (e.g. government department, institution, corporation or business) and the specific natural legal entities/individuals who were involved in enabling or using the AI for the particular artifact or event. Some of these methods include:_\n\n_-  Digital Signatures: Using digital signatures to verify the authenticity of AI content or software actions, and to link them to the legal entity or individual responsible for them._\n\n_-  Attribution Statements: Including an attribution statement in the AI content or software that identifies the legal entity or individual responsible for it._\n\n_-  Watermarking: Watermarking AI content or software with unique identifiers that can be used to trace it back to the legal entity or individual responsible for it._\n\n_-  Logging: Keeping detailed logs of who had access to and used the AI system, and what actions they took._\n\n_-  Transparency Reports: Publishing transparency reports that provide information on the legal entities and individuals involved in the development and use of AI, as well as the system's decision-making processes and any human rights considerations._\n\n_-  Certifications: Certifying the AI system by a third-party, that verifies that the system meets certain standards, such as fairness and transparency_\n\n_-  Source codes or system architecture: Making the source codes or system architecture of AI systems available for public inspection, in order for third parties to verify how the systems make decisions._\n\n_-  Human oversight: Ensuring that AI systems are designed with human oversight and decision-making capabilities to make adjustments or corrections if necessary, and keeping records of those adjustments or corrections._\n\n_Overall, it is important to ensure that the AI system are clearly labeled and that the legal entity or individual responsible for the system is easily identifiable and can be held accountable for its actions. This can be achieved through a combination of technical and organizational measures, such as the ones listed above, which should be chosen according to the specific context and the potential impacts of the system._\n\n_Another way of clearly labelling AI content and/or software actions and associating them with the legal entity responsible for them, is by using blockchain technology, it can enable the creation of an immutable and transparent record of the origin and usage of the AI content or software. This can enable users to verify the authenticity of the content and trace it back to the legal entity or individual that created it, providing a tamper-proof record of the development and usage of the AI system._\n\n_Another approach to clearly identify the responsible entity is by using standard data labels, like the \"metadata\" of digital files, AI artifacts should also have standard labels that clearly identify the legal entity or individual responsible for them, such as the developer, creator, owner, or operator._\n\n_Additionally, governments could also play a role in promoting transparency and accountability of AI systems by implementing regulations and guidelines on the labeling of AI content and software actions, and enforcing penalties for non-compliance._\n\n_Finally, it is important to note that it is not just a technical problem but also a societal one, and that it requires a multi-stakeholder approach, which includes industry, civil society, and government, to develop a solution and to ensure that it is effectively implemented._\n\n_Another way of clearly labeling AI content and/or software actions is by using certification systems. These systems involve an independent third party, such as a regulatory agency or industry group, evaluating the AI system and verifying that it meets certain standards, such as transparency, fairness, and accountability. These certifications can be used to clearly label the AI system and to provide assurance to users that the system has been independently reviewed and found to be trustworthy._\n\n_Another way of clearly labelling AI content and/or software actions is by using explainable AI (XAI) techniques, these techniques allow the AI system to explain its decision-making process to users in a way that is easy for humans to understand. This can help users to trust the system and to understand how it makes decisions, and also make it easier for legal entities or individuals to be held accountable for the actions of the system._\n\n_Finally, it is important to educate the public about the importance of clearly labeling AI content and/or software actions and associating them with the legal entity responsible for them. This can help to increase awareness of the risks associated with AI and to promote responsible use of the technology._\n\n_In summary, there are many methods for clearly labelling AI content and/or software actions and associating them with the legal entity responsible for them, such as digital signatures, attribution statements, watermarking, logging, transparency reports, certifications, blockchain, standard data labels, explainable AI (XAI) and education. These methods can be used in combination to provide a comprehensive approach to transparency and accountability of AI systems._\n\n> My Question:\n\n> How might an ontology using RDF and common vocabularies be defined to provide a means to deploy these sorts of solutions? Can you give me an example of an RDF OWL ontology?\n\n_ChatGPT Answer:_\n\n_An ontology using RDF and common vocabularies can provide a structured way to describe and represent information related to the legal entity responsible for AI content and/or software actions, as well as the actions themselves. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a standard for modeling information on the web, and it provides a way to express the relationships between resources (e.g. documents, people, and concepts) using a graph-based structure._\n\n_A simple example of an RDF OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology for describing AI content and software actions could include classes such as \"AI system\", \"Legal entity\", \"Individual\", \"Action\", and \"Responsibility\". Each class would have a set of properties that describe their characteristics and relationships, such as \"name\", \"developer\", \"owner\", \"operator\", \"decision-making process\" and \"Standards met\", respectively._\n\n_For example, the class \"AI system\" could have properties such as \"name\", \"developer\", \"owner\", \"operator\" and \"decision-making process\". The class \"Legal entity\" would have properties such as \"name\", \"type\" (e.g. government department, institution, corporation or business), \"location\", and \"jurisdiction\". The class \"Individual\" would have properties such as \"name\" and \"role\" (e.g. developer, owner, operator). The class \"Action\" would have properties such as \"name\", \"date\", \"type\" (e.g. decision, action) and \"outcome\". The class \"Responsibility\" would have properties such as \"level\" (e.g. primary, secondary, etc) and \"entity\" (e.g. legal entity, individual)_\n\n_These classes and properties can be interconnected to describe complex relationships between AI systems, legal entities, individuals, and actions, and can be used to trace the origin and usage of AI content and software actions, and to establish accountability and transparency. The use of common vocabularies, such as schema.org and others, would help to standardize the representation of the information and make it more easily understandable and usable by different systems and applications._\n\n_It's worth noting that this is just a simple example and that a more comprehensive ontology would be more complex and take into account the specific context and use case. And that, the use of RDF and OWL enables the use of formal reasoning to infer new information from the ontology, which is particularly useful for the transparency and accountability of AI systems._\n\n_Additionally, using RDF and OWL to represent an ontology can enable the use of formal reasoning to infer new information from the ontology, this is particularly useful for transparency and accountability of AI systems. For example, by creating inferences rules in the ontology, you can automatically infer information about the legal entities, individuals and actions responsible for an AI system, based on the properties of the AI system._\n\n_Moreover, using RDF and OWL in this context can also enable the integration of the ontology with other systems, such as databases, document management systems and even other AI systems. This is particularly useful for creating transparency and accountability solutions, where information about AI systems, legal entities and individuals need to be shared and combined across different systems._\n\n_Another advantage of using RDF and OWL is that they can leverage the Linked Data ecosystem, which allows for easy data sharing and integration across different organizations and domains. This allows for more collaboration between different stakeholders, like industry, civil society and government, to help ensure the transparency and accountability of AI systems._\n\n_Finally, it is important to note that creating an ontology is just a first step, the ontology itself should be continuously updated, maintained, and evaluated to make sure it is still useful and useful, to address the complexity and dynamic nature of the field of AI._\n\n> My Question:\n\n> can you write an example in notation3 syntax.\n\n_ChatGPT Answer:_\n\n_Sure, here is an example of an RDF ontology written in Notation3 (N3) syntax to describe an AI system and its responsible legal entities and individuals:_\n\n```\n\n@prefix ai: <http://example.com/ontology/ai#> \n@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n@prefix org: <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#> .\n\n\nai:MyAI a ai:AI;\n    ai:name \"My AI System\";\n    ai:developer [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name \"John Doe\" ];\n    ai:owner [ a org:Organization; org:name \"Acme Inc.\" ];\n    ai:operator [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name \"Jane Smith\" ];\n    ai:decision-makingProcess \"Explainable AI using Decision Trees\" ..\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the ontology defines a class \"AI\" (ai:AI) and an instance of that class \"MyAI\" (ai:MyAI), it also specifies that \"MyAI\" has a name \"My AI System\", a developer \"John Doe\" (foaf:Person), an owner \"Acme Inc.\" (org:Organization), an operator \"Jane Smith\" (foaf:Person) and a decision-making process \"Explainable AI using Decision Trees\"_\n\n_This ontology uses prefixes to simplify the URIs (ai:, foaf:, org:) used in the statements. The prefixes indicate that the URIs in the ontology are from the given namespace, so \"ai:AI\" refers to the URI \"[http://example.com/ontology/ai#AI](http://example.com/ontology/ai#AI)\"._\n\n_Note that this is a simplified example, in real-world scenarios, the ontology would likely have more classes and properties and also, would relate to other ontologies to provide more context and meaning, such as time, location, standards met, etc._\n\n_Additionally, the ontology can include more classes and properties such as \"Action\", \"Responsibility\", \"Jurisdiction\", \"Location\", \"Date\", \"Standards\", \"Certification\" and \"TransparencyReports\" that describe the actions taken by the AI system, the level of responsibility of the legal entities and individuals, the jurisdiction, location, date of action, standards met, certifications achieved and transparency reports respectively._\n\n_Here's an example of how these classes and properties can be added to the ontology:_\n\n```\n\n@prefix ai: <http://example.com/ontology/ai#> \n@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n@prefix org: <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n\nai:MyAI a ai:AI;\n    ai:name \"My AI System\";\n    ai:developer [ a foaf:Person;

This is used to make the JSON-LD data more easily readable for both machines and humans. As before, it's important to note that this is just an example and that the ontology can be much more detailed, depending on the complexity and dynamic nature of the field of AI._\n\n**CONSIDERATIONS**\n\nWhilst the specific approach certainly requires a great deal more work and consideration, the merit of the underlying notion appears to be considered important even by ChatGPT.  \n\n### Knowledge Qualification Methods\n\nThe advent of AI, is far more significant than the implications of the time where caculators became easily accessible. So, as is connected to the topic; and an area of consideration by many presently,\n\n> I've asked OpenAI / ChatGPT the following;\n\n> What are some practical courses of action that could assist educators in seeking to evaluate whether a student understands a topic or subject that they've been required to study, but may have used an AI program to produce a written report that is submitted - without necessarily understanding what it is the activity was intended to support the students ability to learn about and gain knowledge about, the topic.\n\n> What sorts of activities could be undertaken to evaluate whether or not a student has gained knowledge about the topic, rather than more simply, having used an AI program to provide reports that may pass traditional tests without the student necessarily understanding or gaining knowledge of the topic, subject and/or related concepts.?\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\n_There are several practical courses of action that educators can take to evaluate whether a student understands a topic or subject that they've been required to study, even if they have used an AI program to produce a written report. Here are a few examples:_\n\n_1. Oral or written questioning: One effective way to evaluate understanding is through oral or written questioning. The educator can ask the student to explain or summarize key concepts or ideas related to the topic, or to provide examples of how they apply the knowledge in a specific scenario._\n\n_2. Hands-on activities: Another way to evaluate understanding is through hands-on activities such as problem-solving exercises, lab experiments, or group projects. These activities allow the student to demonstrate their understanding of the topic in a practical setting._\n\n_3. In-class participation: Educators can observe and evaluate the student's level of understanding through in-class participation, such as group discussions, debates, or presentations. Through this, the educators can see the level of engagement and understanding of the student._\n\n_4. Self-reflection and feedback: Educators can ask the students to reflect on their learning process and provide feedback on the effectiveness of the learning methods they have used. Through this, the educators can evaluate if the student has gained knowledge about the topic or not._\n\n_5. Peer evaluation: Educators can also ask students to evaluate each other’s understanding of the topic, this can be done through a peer review or through small group discussions, where students can identify areas of misunderstanding and help one another to understand the topic better._\n\n_6. Use of Authentic Assessment: Educators can use tasks that are similar to what students may encounter in the real world, this allows students to apply their understanding of the topic in more meaningful and relevant context, thus evaluating the real understanding._\n\n_It's worth mentioning that this list is not exhaustive, and that each educator should choose the approach that they think is the best fit for the specific subject, students, and context. Additionally, a combination of several of these methods might yield more accurate results._\n\n_Another approach educators can take is to design assessments that are difficult for AI software to complete, for example, assessments that require students to integrate or apply multiple pieces of information, or that require creativity, critical thinking, or complex problem-solving skills. Such assessments are more likely to be difficult for AI software to complete as they are not based on simple pattern recognition, but on sophisticated abilities that are characteristic of human intelligence._\n\n_Additionally, incorporating more open-ended questions that require students to provide explanations or to justify their reasoning can also be an effective way to evaluate whether students have a deep understanding of the topic, rather than just recognizing patterns in the text._\n\n_In addition to these approaches, educators can also use plagiarism detection software to identify instances where students have used AI to produce written reports without understanding the topic. However, it is important to note that plagiarism detection software is not a foolproof method, as it can only detect text that has been copied and pasted from other sources, not text that has been generated by AI._\n\n_Finally, Educators should also be aware of their own role in fostering the critical thinking and understanding of the students, by providing clear learning objectives, providing appropriate resources and providing opportunities for feedback and continuous improvement._\n\n### _Final Remarks;_\n\nOver the last few days, i've generated a few linkedin articles related to the issues that have seemed to be inexorable, relating to AI, Human Agency, Human Rights, Digital Identity and in-turn factors that are related to my works to produce an ecosystems solution that i've called Webizen (See [DevDocs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/)); that in-turn provides an opportunity to decentralise AI and address various social issues including but not limited to, digital slavery and other Human Rights related considerations. In-turn these works requires an approach that is not simply technical; but also social, and whilst the availability of these global AI platforms is kinda frightening in some ways; it is clearly demonstrated, that the benefits far outweigh the jeporody, at the present time. It is important we decentralise AI and support Human Agency, which is a necessity in relation to both human rights more broadly; and in-turn, the ability to be ruled by law, the underlying foundations required by societies at large - where the people seek a system of government that is defined as a form of liberalised democracy.\n\nYet, as is (quickly) illustrated in my earlier articles; alongside this one,\n\n-   [AI, Digital Identity & Guardianship Systems?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-digital-identity-guardianship-systems-timothy-holborn/)\n-   [Is Chat GPT the most useful tool accessibly available to solve social problems? Here is a recent example.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chat-gpt-most-useful-tool-accessibly-available-solve-social-holborn/)\n\nThe apparent fact is, that there are various agendas that have existed for a very long time, and some of the actors involved in these sorts of agendas and historical wrongs; notably including [RoboDebt](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/2030-people-have-died-after-receiving-centrelink-robodebt-notice/10821272) and the consequential [Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme](https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/about), yet this example pales by comparison to the broader productivity and ESG implications that are able to be addressed in ways that are far more energy efficient, through the use of AI systems. The ESG implications are indeed enormous; yet, the moral jeporody which will in-turn have meaningful socio-economic implications - is not yet addressed.\n\nWhilst my [Human Centric AI](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1137273419765842) works continue; it is difficult to consider how it is reasonable to expect that government is at all equipped to provide appropriate moral leadership in this very important area of humanitarian advancement. The implications of [#NobodyAI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/nobodyai) is amongst the underlying drivers of [Existential risk from artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_general_intelligence) and the underlying problem isn't actually technical, its social. its the ramifications of having to address the issue of being required to produce accountability systems, that many don't want.\n\nThe situation at the moment appears to be; that whilst tools like ChatAI / ChatGPT may not provide the best and most correct answers, it does a far better job of providing some sort of useful feedback than should ever be historically considered to be expected to be provided honestly and with integrity, by our Government. There are opportunities to address all sorts of issues in ways that were not previously possible, but, it is important to decentralise, it is also important to figure out how to define some sensible rules and produce tools to support those sorts of considerations; even if, they're only provided as an option - that may in-turn lead to a circumstance where those who use tools to support what i call [Safety Protocols](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/WebScience/SafetyProtocols/), may be distinguished from others who gainfully seek to do otherwise. Whilst some people may look at the situation and think - 'but robots can't be sent to prison', and consider it to be a problem... Others, will see it as an opportunity. It will be interesting to see how will values align different social groups, as its certainly the case that solutions can be forged, if there's a desire to do so.\n\nI might also note, that whilst i've been the recipient of standard template based corraspondance from various government departments; including those relating to law, where false statements relating to some other case / circumstance was made; in a manner that had nothing to do with me, and was later used to by another person for the purpose of engendering an attack - something, that the government department in question and specified persons involved - sought not to take on any responsibility about (nor did they originally - as is part of the underlying problem); this asymmetical method of interaction that brings with it support for various [Social Attack Vectors](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/SocialAttackVectors/), is no longer simply something that is easily done solely by those as sophistocated as public institutions of trust.\n\nIt may well be found, that there are alot of people who do not understand the responsibilities associated with the job roles they carry out; it may otherwise become the case, that these sorts of ramifications are considerd a lower priority, than the opportunity to simply employ lower-skilled persons, whose job it is to simply press the buttons to get AI to do the jobs."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/LinkedInArticles/ReinventingTheKindnessEquation/","title":"Reinventing the Kindness Equation"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Reinventing the Kindness Equation\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reinventing-kindness-equation-timothy-holborn/\n\nMarch 6, 2017\n\n_“WWW as a publishing environment produced by the works of leading experts in areas of Science Technology Engineering Arts and mathematics (\"STEAM\") is not simply rocket-science, it is the underpinning 'state of the art' works that is used, to undertake rocket science and more broadly, to define the rules and means in which we live.”_\n\n_From the Post-War War II era, Humanity accumulated many advancements from the formation of the_ [_Universal Declaration of Human Rights_](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)_, first read aloud by_ [_Eleanor Roosevelt_](http://www.unmultimedia.org/avlibrary/asset/C100/C1007/)_, through to other illustrations of ‘dignity enshrining’ works in through the growth of the union movement, medical advancements in both areas of capability and policy, alongside education, access to justice (legal aid), shipping, and an array of other important moments in time where decisions were made, forging the foundations of our modern society that we build upon today._ [_The Trust Factory_](http://2017.trustfactory.org/) _is an event to be held in Perth on the 3rd of April as part of the_ [_World Wide Web Festival_](http://www.festivaloftheweb.com.au/)_, to explore how the acts of value based decisions have changed since the pre-www age and the new opportunities in future._\n\nIn 1980 [OECD Guidelines](http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm) on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data were delivered by a group of government experts under the chairmanship of [The Hon. Mr. Justice M.D. Kirby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kirby_(judge)), Chairman of the Australian Law Reform Commission that; “although national laws and policies may differ, Member countries have a common interest in protecting privacy and individual liberties, and in reconciling fundamental but competing values such as privacy and the free flow of information” setting out a series of recommendations _“which would help to harmonise national privacy legislation and, while upholding such human rights, would at the same time prevent interruptions in international flows of data.”_ \n\nIn Perth, a campaign set-out to win the America’s Cup and in 1983, [Australia II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_II) (KA6) famously won, facing off against Dennis Conner sailing aboard ‘liberty’. In 1987 off the coast of Perth, Australia, Dennis Conner and onboard Stars & Stripes, won back the cup as challenger, Four races to nil. At around the same time Richard Heale, was as a lecturer in Western Australian Universities which led to Established “interactive design” courses in 1989 at University of Western Australia as demand for interactive courseware within the mining sector brought about demand for ‘new media’ companies. Meanwhile internationally, two computer scientists developed a solution to resolve the basic problem “how do people from different organisations share knowledge”. Building upon the works of o[thers before them](http://www.w3.org/2004/Talks/w3c10-HowItAllStarted/); such as those accomplished by [Ted Nelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) (hypertext/hypermedia) and [Vinton Cerf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) (internet protocol), the first web-browser was born at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. In December 1991 at the HyperText Conference in San Antonio (Texas USA); the ‘World Wide Web’ proposal put forward by Tim Berners-Lee was accepted only as a [poster-session](http://www.w3.org/2004/Talks/w3c10-HowItAllStarted/all.html).\n\nBack in Perth, Richard Heale, in 1992, established the Australian interactive Media Industry association (“[AIMIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Interactive_Media_Industry_Association)”) whilst in the following year, through the works of those such as [Geoff Hudson and Peter Elford](http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/OzI04.html#RUP), Internet was brought to Australia as the first web-browser ‘[NCSA's Mosaic browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser))’ (released November 1993).\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQH3SkjuR9vdnA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1520115194988?e=1679529600&v=beta&t=kP3Dul3CxZ-7JhdnGtLL08zBG2d4n1V_aKetTv8B3mY)\n\nThe launch of the netscape browser in 1994, whilst removing the ‘edit’ function built into the original browser by Tim Berners-Lee, led to the explosive growth of the web as those such as [Steven Outtrim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Outtrim) started amongst the first Web Businesses, [Sausage Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage_Software) providing easy to use website development tools becoming one of the most popular websites at the time with 250,000 hits per day in 1996.\n\nOver the next few years the world wide web grew to become the ‘killer app’ for personal computing. An industry emerged as organisations, institutions, government departments and ministers started to get their first websites. In 1998, Australia hosted for the first time, the world wide web conference (www1998). \n\nIn 1999 Tim Berners-Lee published “[_Weaving the Web: The Original Design and ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor._](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/Overview.html)”. The internet industry grew from being a relatively specialised field to the beginnings of the pervasive online world as executives sought assistance learning how to use email as part of their work demands, whilst early web scientists continued to work on a concept entitled “The Semantic Web”, a concept powered by ‘linked data’, that started gain shape as Scientific American published amongst the first [articles](http://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html) by Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler and Ora Lassila speaking about a web they wanted to develop that understood knowledge representation, a web for knowledge representation.\n\n_“The Semantic Web will enable machines to COMPREHEND semantic documents and data, not human speech and writings.” May 17 2001, Scientificamerican.com “the semantic web”_\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQFti3lC1ZP1bA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520165293081?e=1679529600&v=beta&t=sKzHXdHRLlx2IwexdQ6gVJjU1BWtFb2fRoGdJSwUqU4)\n\nThe means to host website connected to databases became easier to produce as courses started to be provided by universities educating a new breed of talent that led to online mail, social networking, e-commerce and the advent of online mapping services such as Keyhole Inc.  During the [2003 invasion of Iraq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq), when Dave Lorenzini enticed [CNN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN), [ABC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company), [CBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS) and other major news networks to use their sophisticated 3D flyby imagery to illustrate Baghdad Activities, in exchange for on-air attribution of their “KeyHole” platform. In the following year Google Acquired the company forming what is now called ‘Google Earth’.\n\nIn 2007 Steve Jobs announced the iPhone. In less than a decade more than [1 billion iPhones](http://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/07/apple-celebrates-one-billion-iphones.html) have been sold worldwide through a decade of internet powered, economic development that is now inextricably linked to the lives of billions of humans across the world for many, everyday tasks and whilst the availability of mapping on mobile devices changed the nature of discovering places and means of navigating the world around us, the elements of history brought about by a few extraordinary people are still embedded in our web today. The language used to add items to google maps is still called “KML” denoting “[Keyhole Markup Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language)”.\n\nFrom 2007 [OpenLink Software](http://www.openlinksw.com/), Founded by Kingsley Idehen brought Semantic Web interfaces to traditional database platforms. [From 2007](http://www.w3.org/wiki/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData/BanffGathering) information about the world, as contributed to sites such as Wikipedia were made available with the help of OpenLink Software to establish some of the first online “linked data” services, DBpedia in 2007. In 2008, at WWW2008, Tim Berners-Lee delivered a [Keynote address](http://www.w3.org/2008/Talks/WWW2008-W3CTrack-LOD.pdf) entitled ‘The Future of Web Applications’ introducing “the web of documents and the web of data” and the use of DBpedia as an instrumental part of progress.\n\nAt around the same time (2007) Manu Sporny started to consider how to support payments, as he considered the problem “[_You couldn’t tell your Web browser something like “I trust the New York Times, let them charge me $0.05 per article up to $10 per month for access to their website_](http://manu.sporny.org/2014/dawn-of-web-payments/)_”_.” Not only would solving this problem require a means to communicate payments, but also a means to identify the parties involved. In 2009 the PaySwarm Community group was formed and in 2011 it was renamed to ‘[Web Payments Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/)’ with designs depending heavily on the semantic web technology, Linked Data. Later, whilst debating the special [needs](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Jul/0043.html) of humans in relation to identity instruments and humanitarian principles, the [credentials community group](http://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) was born.\n\nBy the early 2010’s the semantic web concept had developed and was rebranded to ‘linked data’ and major global platforms such as Google ([2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph)) and Facebook ([2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Graph_Search)) incorporated ‘semantic search’ into their platforms, powering web experiences in ways never considered at the time by those involved in establishing the online world, back in the late 90s, whilst unusually also, part of the original design thinking for the world wide web. As portals continued to incorporate ever more expanding libraries of data about humans, the Read Write Web Community Group with the support of Tim Berners Lee and his team, centred around [MIT](http://www.csail.mit.edu/), continued to develop alternatives, first entitled ‘read write web’ embracing a concept entitled ‘socially aware cloud storage’, later redefined as [Cross Cloud](http://crosscloud.org/) led by Sandro Hawk of MIT/W3C and [SoLiD](http://solid.mit.edu/), led by Tim Berners Lee, the decentralised team were awarded a 1m USD donation by [MasterCard](http://www.csail.mit.edu/solid_mastercard_gift) to assist in the pursuit to ensure people are able to store and ‘own’ their own data, whilst Tim and a group of [Web Scientists](http://www.webscience.org/wst-board-of-trustees/) continued to develop both an open-data and web science movement.\n\nIn Australia, the efforts of [Pia Waugh](http://pipka.org/), curating the now internationally celebrated ‘[gov hack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GovHack)’ events led to significant development and growth of our local ‘Open Data’ movement as it became an international movement. Internationally, Open data works were later acknowledged and supported by an executive order issued by Barack Obama in 2013 which established an US Government ‘[Open Data Policy](http://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-)”.\n\nAs the web grew with tools to help people build their own web pages, use online mapping ([keyhole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole,_Inc)), [dbPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia) and semantic search powered platforms forged the foundations for our emerging artificial intelligence powered web experiences of today, now incorporating ‘smart assistants’ and an ever expanding ‘web of things’ as our ‘web of data’, that those such as dave lorenzini (now working on augmented reality devices and the next version of maps) explains as the emergence of ‘web side worlds, where the world is notated on the web’ considering the challenges of whether, how and what we notate becoming part of the emerging issues ‘web science professionals’ consider.\n\nAs decisions made in past become the foundations of the next decade, work continues as the tireless and often thankless undertakings made by arguably, far too few people influence our natural world and the experience of life for those in it. As notions of freedom from surveillance increasingly seem antiquated and as web and computer based solutions continue to indiscriminately replace former paper methods, often without support for many of the underlying properties depended upon by society in our pre-www era, such as receipts, local jurisdiction for agreements or notifications of file contents about citizens, whether they be held here or overseas; and indeed experiences of citizens, such as when ideas of a “machine-readable payslip” only becomes a consideration after what has become described as a ‘[robo debt’ crisis](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/centrelinks-robodebt-crisis-who-is-hank-jongen-20170124-gtxn0u.html), illustrates the choices made to portray _less than ideal_ characteristics.\n\nDid we forget about the foundations upon which we provided the means to bring all of this about? What is needed if we want to ensure we _use technology_ to knowingly build societies we are proud to live in, after our church steeples ceased ringing the bells, that preceded the mobile broadband transmission systems that replaced them. As our society advance seeking to develop to become an egalitarian meritocracy, and as interpretations of ‘personhood’ grow from the days of the [Magna Carta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta), how will the world-wide-web support our shared-values?\n\nBetween the 2nd and 9th of April 2017, the [26th International World Wide Web Conference](http://www.www2017.com.au/) returns to Australia for the first time since 1998 and will be hosted by Perth as part of [the Festival of the Web](http://www.festivaloftheweb.com.au/). The series is overseen by the World Wide Web Conferences Committee (IW3C2, which selects the host city three years in advance) and has a long-heritage of facilitating the international means where the future of the web becomes defined.\n\nSpeakers at [Festival of the Web](http://www.festivaloftheweb.com.au/) include a long-list of celebrated contributors to the world wide web, who are coming together to discuss current and future international work items including inclusive decision making for online systems. Through the context of the emergent field of “web science”, a specialised one-day event, “[The Trust Factory](http://2017.trustfactory.org/)” is being presented on Monday the 3rd of April 2017. [The Trust Factory](http://2017.trustfactory.org/), delivers lightning talks and roundtable discussions with celebrated local and international leaders including; Pindar Wong (Internet Evangelist, HK.) , Dave Lorenzini (founder KeyHole), Pia Waugh (Founder GovHack), Manu Sporny (Founder Web Payments), David Hyland-Wood (Co-Chair RDF (“linked data”)), Narelle Clark (ACCAN), Allyn Radford (Former IMS Global), Nigel Phair (Centre for Internet Safety), Richard Heale (Founder AIMIA), Andrew Macleod (UN, Red Cross, RioTinto, British/Australian Army, UK/AU Professor & Humanitarian Lawyer).\n\nAs new “naturalised interfaces” emerge with an ever more pervasive ‘web of data’, connecting ‘things’, articulating attributes of persona with sensors, credentials, payments and continuous interactions between life and a plurality of network connected devices; the challenges we’ve faced as a society before, pale in comparison to those emerging into the world around us. As Artificial Intelligence continues to activate WWW means to build upon real-world commercial principles to powers institutions, organisations and corporations, who in-turn seek to provide fewer real-world interactions which can lead symptomatically, set aside important needs of humans as citizens.\n\nBasic questions; such as, whether and how a citizen may retain a relationship to the data produced by them, about them; and whether, the total cost of ownership for the digital identity infrastructure may be engineered to become prohibitively expensive for some, to take-part in our societies. In-order to resolve these forms of underlying issues we urgently require a progressive platform for a meaningful values based discussion “in good faith”.\n\nHow much should it cost per month to maintain access to your identity? Can you switch providers? Is it reasonable to be living in a world of fake-news - as the issues experienced by humans truly do matter more than the financial performance of a legal entity (“[_persona ficta_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality)”) selling advertising or other energy consuming products and services, how is it reasonable to suggest ‘fake news’ is ok or has no effect on society. How is every living human being on this planet empowered to contribute and be recognised for their contributions to the world around us, as the future sustainability of our planet in ‘[the lemon age, where nothing lasts forever - or even a year](http://www.theage.com.au/comment/welcome-to-the-lemon-age-where-nothing-lasts-forever--or-even-a-year-20170302-gupeba.html)’ and we have the means to track everyone, everywhere, all the time.\n\nHow is society using internet to support the needs of vulnerable people in crisis or whose issues have been otherwise forgotten about for longer than is reasonable, as though they do not matter. What should the new expectations of citizens be for online fairness and budget allocations; as we are all vulnerable when we can no-longer trust in each-other, or the means in which furnish trust to others ‘in good faith’. \n\nAs documents become data stored in databases, recording calls, automating systems building records relied upon by institutions how is it we seek to redefine our ‘rule of law’ as timely access to evidence becomes subject to new, data policies across not simply one institution but rather the organisms produced by analysts in plurality. In a world in which we seek to thrive in a society ruled by law, as to grow and contribute to our fullest potential as a valued member of community how do our shared values, such as dignity, apply in these emerging ‘web side worlds’.\n\nThe Trust Factory delivers a spectacular line-up of Local and International experts to present upon a basis of their experiences in past and the purpose of such works for our shared future. Throughout the week [WWW2017](http://www.www2017.com.au/) brings experts from around the world to perth where they will be presenting cutting edge work within the field of linked-data whilst discussing its impacts and opportunities upon the many facets of life in our world, into the future. \n\nIn a world with no real secrets, how is it we choose to redefine ‘the kindness equation’ and how do we preserve ‘dignity’ when privacy is being redefined and freedom from surveillance is becoming obsolete. We have now been living in an age where the choices made by our societal leaders are far less limited by our technological capacities.\n\nAs directors make choices with pervasive outcomes, without so much as hearing a voice or seeing the expression on a disaffected person's face; what does Trust and Accountability mean and how should WWW support us all. As companies feel no pain, the issues of humans become indiscriminate as vicarious trauma becomes well known.\n\nThe Trust Factory breaks down the barriers of considerations by engaging the human debate about the use of technology, as we work to maintain our societies based upon shared-principles and shared-values, as our cities fill with homeless people and communities continue to battle drugs whilst fake news neglects the issues such as mental health and domestic violence that pervasively and indiscriminatory impacts the countless many, in a society where whilst WWW knows the facts - law enforcement still requires victims to supply evidence themselves; and as our society struggles to rationalise the use of energy and the preservation of our natural world as a foundation for ensuring future generations have the opportunity to maintain a healthy life without unnecessary medical costs. The means to gain timely access to important data and how new policy may respond to our modern social challenges, by whomever shall choose to do it, brings with it challenges that rock the foundations in a manner that is not about technology; but rather, the means in which the future of our ‘human factories’ are collaboratively defined upon principles founded upon trust.  \n\nWe are amongst the last of our species who will remember a world without the web. In the interests of bringing about lasting, positive growth for the future of our species and our natural world, the Trust Factory convenes experts for a once in a lifetime opportunity at the Perth Convention Centre on the 3rd of April 2017 by a collaborative founded upon knowledge of kindness and dignity; which we strive to enshrine for future generations."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/LinkedInArticles/WhatIsTheDefinitionOfAnAIWeapon/","title":"What is the Definition of an 'AI Weapon'"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# What is the Definition of an 'AI Weapon'\n\nJuly 30, 2015\n\nLink: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/definition-ai-weapon-timothy-holborn/\n\nI've been considering the recent global news regarding the dangers of '[AI Weapons](http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter_autonomous_weapons)', I was looking for some feedback on what would be defined as an 'AI Weapon'...\n\nBasic Research says, common terms talk of '[arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race)'[2], '[weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon)'[3], yet perhaps distinctions reasonably relate to any form of '[warfare](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/warfare)'[4], whether that be '[economic warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_warfare)'[5], perhaps '[information warfare'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare)[6] or perhaps more explicitly, conventional warfare or other acts of [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War) [7] generally....\n\nYet, from a laypersons point of view, a weapon seems more like something that can be used to harm or control another by way of act or threats of acting as to utilise the 'weapon'...\n\nFactors of self-defence are also important to consider.  In-turn, at least from a philosophical point of view, far more complex issues in-turn come to mind, such as [the statistics on police shootings in different regions](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries) \n\nSo, at the risk of reading far too deeply into the work that has been promoted via various news networks, World-Wide; I've posted my first thing on linked-in, seeking the input of others who consider the merits of the aforementioned open-letter in the broader sense, and therein seek your views. \n\nWithin the field of work for which i am involved, some of the Questions I ponder, relates to both storage and in-turn how systems enable the use of agents[8], pending their distinction (what sort of 'agent' they are).  \n\n-   How non-human agents are made capable?\n-   How should they be shut down if necessary?\n\nand perhaps implicitly, pursuant to some of the [web-science](https://twitter.com/WebCivics/status/492707794760392704) [9] concepts within the field of linked-data,\n\n-   How might these sorts of concepts apply to new industrious concepts such as [autonomous organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) [10].  \n-   How do these concepts apply to 'choice of law' with relation to online services and data-storage?\n\nChoices are made between methodological manifests that result in some form of product, whether they centralise control methods, corruptible or believed to be otherwise, or whether they decentralise and/or depend upon human intervention.\n\nA lay concept may look something like defining mean that enable distinctions to be made between 'trust' as it is applied by; either,\n\n1.  Accountable people / groups of people (whilst maintaining a decentralised method in the groups / people / interdependencies, similar to global systems of democracy, [et.al](http://et.al/).); OR,\n2.  'Trust', as it is applied by a computational / Hardware + Software Communications platform that supports the manifest outcome of trust computationally, subject to the variabilities of the underlying assumptions made; OR,\n3.  A mixture.\n\nWhen considering computational trust, I think of bitcoin and it's 51% vulnerability, which in [this thread](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/658/what-can-an-attacker-with-51-of-hash-power-do) [11] is described in relation to $ rather than accountability methodologies.  Bitcoin could technically be used as a means to support e-contracts and other formats of trade.  When considering the [IOU nature of $](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI5CFQXJxcA) and transactional demands of systems, should they effectively be capable of high-frequency transactions as required by markets extend the considerations, in-turn may consider that it is the h/w perhaps that is most important ?  \n\nSo, the chain could issue an academic credential based on a bitcoin block / chain / notation; yet, i'm not sure how that would change if it was subject to change in future (ie: someone cheated)...\n\nSo, whilst i've prompted the question with a few considerations; the underlying question is about the  views of those on the list, about what is an 'AI Weapon'...  \nGiven so few in the world understand [linked-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) [12], i figured it was a reasonable question to ask the various groups. \n\nWhat would protect and/or uphold the concept, of preventing the creation of 'AI Weapons'.  What is the definition of an 'AI Weapon'.  \n\nIf others were going to add-value to the sentiment made about [AI Weapons](http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter_autonomous_weapons) [1] what would you say...\n\nUnderlying it all, is the reality of living in a world with such advanced technologies, yet comprehending the difficulties that so many humans experience regardless of what is technologically available, as would protect persons from the same issue, should they be of different circumstance, the implications of improving public data is one very simple example of how things might improve for the better, once better data is available for research, and consideration by our systems of law. \n\nIf we are to find a means in which to listen to those who have signed this document, what is it that we'll need to consider? \n\nFirst thing is perhaps, defining what an AI Weapon actually is...  \n\nSo what are your views?\n\nLINKS\n\n[1] [http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter_autonomous_weapons](http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter_autonomous_weapons)\n\n[2] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race)\n\n[3] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon)\n\n[4] [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/warfare](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/warfare)\n\n[5] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_warfare)\n\n[6] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare)\n\n[7] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War)\n\n[8] [http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent)\n\n[9] [http://www.w3.org/2007/09/map/main.jpg](http://www.w3.org/2007/09/map/main.jpg)\n\n[10] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)\n\n[11] [http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/658/what-can-an-attacker-with-51-of-hash-power-do](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/658/what-can-an-attacker-with-51-of-hash-power-do)\n\n[12] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/LinkedInArticles/linkedinNoteAIDigitalIdentity&Guardianship Systems/","title":"AI, Digital Identity & Guardianship Systems?"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# AI, Digital Identity & Guardianship Systems?\n\n***Below are two articles i wrote and published onto linkedin, the links are below.***\n\n- https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-digital-identity-guardianship-systems-timothy-holborn/\n- https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chat-gpt-most-useful-tool-accessibly-available-solve-social-holborn/\n\nThe importance of this topic, for the development of the ecosystem designs, is very high. \n\n***Below is a copy of both articles - one after the other...***\n\nAs i'm working through the design process to form what i hope to become a useful technology ecosystem, i'm stuck on a problem that - doesn't matter too much for my purposes now; but if the concept develops, it'll be important to have a solution thought out ahead of time; and more broadly, with respect to society at large - I would have thought it was important for others to consider, irraspective of whether or not my works become usefully deployable.\n\nThat problem is - how to attend to the needs of persons who have some sort of guardianship related requirements. Persons who are not independently, legally capable of making their own decisions. How do you define an Authentication, Information management and Artificial Intelligence related permissions framework that best supports the needs of the person subject to some sort of guardianship related permissions system?\n\nIn my designs for an ecosystem that i've called Webizen, it is intended that in-future Adults go and buy a computing box, broadly called a Webizen. This connects to an online service that enables them to host and manage their own information and use apps that work in a way that means that they store their own information. The box, is like a digital vault, that connects to a persons devices and acts as a sort of web-server for their own personal information; enabling them to have their own AI agent (the webizen) that is defined by them to act in their interests; and support their needs in daily life. It provides an alternative to digital identity wallets, whilst offering the ability to support their means to retain copies of important documents, whether that be digital receipts; or their own copy of a call that the other party is recording.\n\n![[WebizenPeaceBot.png]]\n\nIt provides an ability to use ChatGPT like service, but privately; and it supports the means for the Webizen Owner to support their own 'smart home' privately. An old example of how these sorts of systems work is presented in the video below,\n\nPut simply; the applications are independant to where the data (of each user) is stored; and in-turn, the webizen ecosystem works are uplifting old works - to shift away from a model that was previously about 'knowledge banks' that supported human agency, given there was clearly no interest shown by the market in seeking to provide that sort of thing; towards a different model, which is about people owning their own robots - that i call - webizen...\n\nThere's alot about how this ecosystem works that is very different to others; and at the heart of it all, is a desire to support the human rights of persons, in all sorts of meaningful ways. Yet. In-order to support the means for people to have this sort of device, and thereby also make use of various different types of currencies (including those relating to our biosphere (ie: energy) and sociosphere); and, in-order to provide an environment that supports safety protocols, that in-turn need - overall - needs to be linked with an 'identity'; as is also required to ensure that the person who buys a webizen, owns the fundamental part of the webizen that relates to them - their own private database of their lives, in-effect.\n\nSo whilst there's many applications more broadly - the fundamental one of great importance is to provide a means through which natural persons in their private capacity may be furnished with the tools to be provided digital agency.\n\n![[webizen_diagram_1-2.jpg]]\n\nA basic diagram\n\nIn the diagram above, it illustrates the idea of a person having their own private database / vault, which is connected to / operating on various devices in their private networking environment; and that, the point being - they own their information. They can set-up their own online service or use one that is provided by a 'webizen alliance member'... therein also, is a seperate database system, that decentralises 'commons' information, that comes from various sources, has various stewards who have permissions in relation to the modification of those resources; but that, they're able to be distributed so that the local 'webizen agent' can process the information locally, without having to generate communications about what people are - in-effect - thinking about, all the time..\n\nSO, the implication is that people effectively own their own private database that stores all the records about their lives - it is owned by them, and when they create electronic contracts with others to share and/or interact with others - that is managed via the permissive commons systems. It's ok if there's more than 1 person using a device attached to these systems because the private databases are independently stored to support that particular person. This means in-turn, that there needs to be a way to assign the ownership of that database (and related authentication / management instruments, etc.) to the owner of it.\n\nThereafter; how should these sorts of systems be provided to children, or how should permissions change if an elderly person is suffering from alzheimer's disease, or similar.\n\nHow should permissions be granted if a person becomes legally or medically incapable of managing their own affairs, or indeed - after death. How should carers for persons with severe disabilities be provided permissions to the lives of those persons.\n\n-   Should they be able to delete information? perhaps they abused the person, and they want no evidence.\n-   Should they be provided full and unfettered access to all of the information about that persons life? what if the access is sought via a false claim, as to instigate a wrongful attack.\n-   Should they be entitled to manage the financial affairs of that person? if so, how should disputes or oversight be supported?\n-   Should permission systems relating to parents - be set-aside; should the state become the guardian of all children, or should they simply be deemed an asset / property, like any other IoT device - of the mother of those children; and perhaps assign lawyers or social workers to adults - whilst i am not suggesting that this is the correct approach, it just seems like the sorts of approaches that are socially acceptable, other than simply leaving these issues to foreign authentication / data / AI providers like Google, Apple, Microsoft.\n\nIf these sorts of systems are developed - what Safety Protocols should be defined to protect the vulnerable? How do the vulnerable get access to justice? or is that only a feature that could be designed for the fortunate, those who are less likely to 'cause trouble', in-so-far as those who have suggested to be trusted as public officials might combatively suggest - rather than being able to point to the work that's been done to address these sorts of issues, because as they're 'doing it all already', those reports should be publically available - so that i wouldn't need to go about doing this work, to write about a problem that i cnanot find easily, a method to solve. Whilst my Top-Priority is to develop the first system to support the 'work app' that is in-turn intended to provide means to address the digital slavery issues, broadly,\n\n![[cooperativeProjects.jpg]]\n\nIn seeking to figure out the answer to this future problem; so that i can ensure the designs are equipped to provide a means to support persons other than capable adults; as independent human beings from a computing systems and artificial intelligence related Digital Identity perspective,\n\nI reached-out to the DTA asking them about how the Identity Systems addressed the use-cases related to people who have some sort of guardianship related requirements, this was their response;\n\n> Thank you for contacting the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA). \n\n> Unfortunately, the DTA does not deal with guardianships, and therefore, cannot assist you with your enquiry.\n\n> We would suggest you to reach the Attorney-General’s Deparment:\n\n> Phone: (02) 6141 6666. \n\nSo - Dear Linkedin People - If you are able to point me towards any works that have been done about how to address the authentication and digital identity requirements associated with creating Electronic, AI related information storage, as is required to support personhood, human dignity / human rights, i would be thankful.\n\nNote links to [General AI Docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tFYQBE3i0hyrsBCE_33TiLHtGA7XLBtC) and in-turn also those relating to [Tech Ethics](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uwGax8GvZA2jzJ_UFIoYppijZX4vDsoL). It is believed that the volume of use-cases that need to be made addressible, is a non-trivial amount of work; as such, i would expect the process to take some years before it is done well, if it is indeed the case that it hasn't really been done at all well - yet; As such,\n\nI am presently unsure how these authentication systems should work; i am also unsure how they should be made able to be changed in a timely manner and what sorts of accountability systems should be applied in connection to any guardian related decisions made, in connection to the use and information held within that database.\n\nWhilst the documentation is still developing, the link to the existing [devDocs is here](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) noting that there's much more to be done, particularly with respect to the permissive commons technology works - which are also instrumental. Yet, i do not like the idea of forging a semantic framework that might define persons other than legally capable adults; to be some form of property of others. There are all sorts of issues with that type of ideology, and i'm strongly apposed to it - perhaps the real answer today, is that it is better for vulnerable Australians to seek the support of our American friends, because the locals are reprobates.\n\nidk. i hope not. furthermore, i note, these sorts of issues and opportunities are also meaningful for other regions around the world, so, whoever comes up with the best solution to the problem - i'm fairly sure those who care about loved-ones who may be positively impacted by good design, will be very thankful that someone did the work needed to help.\n\n### Follow-up article;\n\n## Is Chat GPT the most useful tool accessibly available to solve social problems? Here is a recent example.\n\nIn an article i wrote yesterday, i sought to express a desire to figure out how to address an underlying requirement for ecosystems that i'm developing that seek to support Human-Centric-AI and related informatics structures; noting, that it is well within the sphere of normal capacities of adults to enter into contracts that in-turn relate to the purchase of 'things' and therefore ownership of that thing, but for those who have guardianship related requirements, this is more difficult.\n\nHere's a link to the Article; [AI, Digital Identity & Guardianship Systems?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-digital-identity-guardianship-systems-timothy-holborn/)\n\nThis has been an old problem - it is not new. Whilst the works i'm doing in an effort to address the far more broad nature of the underlying problems, is now being refactored; historically, the ability to get practically progressive solutions to address these sorts of problems, has been incredibly difficult. Only yesterday, was i chatting on linkedin with the Australian eSafety Commissioner (i think, could have been someone else using the account, idk); and whilst the account operator (which i think was likely Jullie - whose works i admire generally) provided [the following response](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7018316149700390912/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A7018316149700390912%2C7018336433941741568)&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A(7018336433941741568%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7018316149700390912)&dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A(7018406458631344128%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7018316149700390912)&replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A7018316149700390912%2C7018406458631344128)),\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQGWmNyNiw6Qbw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1673407826754?e=1679529600&v=beta&t=JHe71VmbLlpcGxUhOjJDPdpk2n-guMeYxtrXYi-RLJg)\n\nI soon thereafter recieved an email reply, per below.\n\n![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQHgQRy1QzLB5g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1673407882911?e=1679529600&v=beta&t=XBzipMGQE-cSp0Uh_kmaywECueI9LWwui2cRev1QZYM)\n\nNow, i'm not suggesting that there is a known connection between these two pieces of corraspondance. Frankly, the effect upon my line of enquiry, as is considered to be importantly considered - to address these very important considerations - has not led to any productively useful feedback or support.\n\nThat is - until i decided that i'd ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). Below is a copy of the statement, question and ChatGPT answer log that was produced just moments ago,\n\nI have altered the sequence - by appending the list of affected persons at the top of this article - whereas it was originally the second last question i raised with it.\n\nQ: make a list of the types of circumstances relating to a human being for whom these sorts of requirements are needed to support.\n\n> 1. Children or young people who are not yet legally able to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 2. Individuals with cognitive or developmental disabilities that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 3. Elderly individuals who are experiencing cognitive decline or have diminished capacity to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 4. Individuals with mental illness that affects their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 5. Individuals who are in emergency medical situations and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 6. Individuals who are incapacitated as a result of a physical or neurological injury or illness\n\n> 7. Individuals who have a temporary or permanent loss of consciousness or brain function\n\n> 8. Individuals who are in a state of extreme distress and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 9. Individuals who are under the care of a court-appointed guardian or conservator\n\n> 10. Individuals who are in a long-term care facility or receiving in-home care.\n\n> 11. Individuals who have suffered a traumatic event or have been victims of abuse, which may affect their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.\n\n> 12. Individuals with addiction or substance abuse problems that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.\n\n> 13. Individuals who are in prison or detention centers, and may be limited in their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.\n\n> 14. Individuals with a history of homelessness, or who are currently experiencing homelessness, and may have limited access to information management and technology.\n\n> 15. Individuals who are living in remote or rural areas, and may have limited access to services and support that would help them manage their personal and private information.\n\n> It's important to note that, this list is not exhaustive and there may be other types of circumstances where support to manage personal and private information is needed, it's important to evaluate each situation and the needs of the person on a case by case basis.\n\n> It's important to keep in mind that individuals may experience temporary or permanent changes in their abilities and require different levels of support to manage their personal and private information. The key is to work with the individual and assess their specific needs to provide the appropriate level of support and to make sure that their human rights and autonomy are respected.\n\nNow therefore; here is an illustration of the productivity benefits for doing good work to support human rights, AI Agents such as ChatGPT offers for people who are seeking to produce useful outcomes - without enough support or engagement by others otherwise. (to some degree, i wonder how government employees might in future be expected to at least use these sorts of agents to respond to enquiries in a manner that is better than is historically demonstrated?).\n\n  \n\n---\n\nMy Introductory Statement to ChatGPT:\n\n_I am working on software that supports entity logic._ \n\n_In this design logic;_ \n\n_The term Entity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.)._  \n\n_The terms Agent Centric and Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'. and,_\n\n_The term Human Centric refers to the orientation of information management systems that centre upon the rights, responsibilities and moral ownership of electronic records pertaining to a human being._ \n\n_Some Human Beings are not able to make legal decisions or hold legal responsibility on their own behalf. This may be due to disability, psychiatric illness, aging related conditions, emergency medical situations as well as consideration for the needs of children. This may be considered to relate to persons who have some sort of guardianship requirements to support the persons human rights._\n\n_If each Adult Human being is able to own, store and operate their own data / information and manage their own authentication and permissions systems, but that this cannot be achieved for persons who require some sort of guardianship support; how could systems be designed to support the safety and human dignity / human rights of persons who require guardianship related shared permissions structures and how could those permission structures be defined to support the persons human rights / human dignity?_\n\nChat AI:\n\n> Designing systems that support the safety and human rights of individuals who require guardianship can be a complex task, as it involves balancing the need to protect the individual's rights and dignity with the need to ensure their safety. One approach to this problem is to use a combination of technical and policy-based solutions.\n\n> In terms of technical solutions, systems can be designed to support flexible permission structures that can be tailored to the specific needs of each individual. For example, the system could allow for different levels of access and control depending on the individual's needs and abilities. For example, individuals who require more support may have more limited access to their data, while those who are able to make decisions on their own may have more autonomy.\n\n> In terms of policy-based solutions, systems can be designed to incorporate principles such as transparency, accountability, and privacy by design. These principles can help ensure that the system is designed with the protection of the individual's rights and dignity in mind, and that any decisions or actions taken on their behalf are fully justified and transparent.\n\n> In addition, having clear protocols for guardianship and determining guardianship, and clear transparent communication channels for guardianship decision making would be essential. This can be achieved by having legal frameworks that clearly outline the responsibilities and rights of all parties involved, as well as regular reviews to ensure that the individual's needs are being met and that the guardianship is still needed.\n\n> Ultimately, it is important to involve individuals who require guardianship, their guardians and other stakeholders in the design process to ensure that the system is tailored to their specific needs and that it meets their safety, security and human rights standards.\n\nMy Question: _if a person who requires guardianship is defined as a dependant; who still retains human rights, but is dependant upon one or more others to be supported to maintain a beneficial relationship with those rights; What technical designs could provide the dependent their own digital human agency, perhaps through the ownership of a database that contains their information; but is supported by others who also have access? how might the information be categorised to appropriately provide support, as well as maintaining the dependants right to privacy and freedom of thought?_\n\nChatGPT:\n\n> One approach to providing a dependent with their own digital human agency, while also supporting them with access to their information, could be to use a decentralized database system. This type of system would allow the dependent to have control over their own data, while also allowing designated individuals, such as guardians, to have access to the data as needed.\n\n> The information in the database could be organized in such a way that it supports the dependent's needs and rights, while also protecting their privacy. For example, sensitive personal information could be kept private and only shared with designated individuals on a need-to-know basis. Information that is needed to support the dependent's daily needs could be more easily accessible by their guardians.\n\n> One way to organize the information to support the dependent is to use a hierarchical structure where personal data is separated into different levels of privacy and accessibility. For example, the dependent could have full control over the highest level of data, which includes information such as their medical history, contact information, and personal preferences. The lower level of data is shared with the designated guardians or support people and it can contain information such as appointments, social and other interactions that the dependant would have.\n\n> Another design solution could be to use a permission-based system, where the dependent and their guardians can assign different levels of access to the data for different individuals or groups. For example, the dependent may allow their primary guardian to have full access to all of their data, while other family members or caregivers may have more limited access. Additionally, consider setting up expiration dates for access, so that the data is not indefinitely accessible.\n\n> To maintain the dependent's right to privacy and freedom of thought, it is also important to have clear policies and procedures in place for handling data, as well as regular audits to ensure that the system is in compliance with regulations, standards and to assure dependant's information is being handled appropriately. Additionally, involving the dependant in the decision making process and choices of the systems, protocols and policies that would be employed to support their human agency can help ensure that their needs and rights are being met.\n\n> Another important aspect of maintaining the dependent's right to privacy and freedom of thought is to provide them with the necessary tools and resources to understand and manage their own data. This could include providing training and education on how to use the database and permission system, as well as giving them access to clear and easy-to-understand information about their rights and the policies and procedures that apply to their data.\n\n> Additionally, involving the dependent in the decision-making process when it comes to the use of their data, can be essential. For example, they can have a voice in which of the data they allow to be shared with which parties, and under what conditions.\n\n> Finally, it is important to have robust security measures in place to protect the dependent's data from unauthorized access or misuse. This can include using encryption, secure authentication methods, and regular backups to protect the data from loss or damage.\n\n> In summary, providing a dependent with their own digital human agency can be achieved through the use of decentralized databases and permission-based systems that allow the dependent to have control over their own data, while also allowing designated individuals to have access as needed. The system should be designed to support the dependent's needs and rights, while also protecting their privacy, including through the use of hierarchical data structure, expiration date of access, and involving the dependant in the decision making process of sharing and managing the data. To maintain dependant's rights, security measures must be in place, as well as clear policies and procedures for handling the data, regular audits and involving dependant in the decision making process.\n\nMy Question: _What sorts of policy based mechanisms would be required and/or beneficial to support the human rights of the dependant?_\n\nChatGPT:\n\n> There are a variety of policy-based mechanisms that can be implemented to support the human rights of a dependent. Some of these include:\n\n> 1. Clear legal frameworks: Establishing clear legal frameworks that outline the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved in supporting the dependent, including their guardians, caregivers, and family members. These frameworks should also provide guidelines for decision making and dispute resolution.\n\n>    2. Human rights-based approach: Ensuring that the approach taken to support the dependent is based on the principles of human rights, including the right to autonomy, privacy, and dignity. This should include regular reviews of the dependent's needs and the effectiveness of the support being provided, to ensure that their rights are being respected. \n\n> 3. Transparency and accountability: Implementing systems and procedures that promote transparency and accountability in the handling of the dependent's data and in the decision-making process around their care. This can include regular reporting, regular audits, and mechanisms for addressing grievances.   \n\n> 4. Privacy and security: Developing and implementing policies and procedures that protect the dependent's privacy and personal information, including strict protocols for data handling, regular security reviews, and the use of encryption, authentication and access control mechanisms.   \n\n> 5. Participation and informed consent: Involving the dependent in the decision-making process, providing them with the information necessary to understand the choices being made, and ensuring that they are able to provide informed consent.   \n\n> 6. Independent oversight: Having independent oversight and regular review mechanisms to ensure that the dependent's rights are being respected and protected, and to identify and address any concerns or issues that may arise.   \n\n> 7. Monitoring: Establishing regular monitoring, reporting and review mechanisms to ensure compliance with the above mentioned policy based mechanisms and identify and addressing any issues.\n\n> It is important to note that, depending on the specific context and needs of the dependent, additional policy mechanisms may be necessary to ensure their human rights are protected.\n\n_My Question: If a dependant is unable to independently own or lawfully protect (ie: via courts of law) their own rights relating the ownership, storage and use of their own personal and private information; how might a legal structure be devised to support their needs, with the support of others?_\n\nChatGPT:\n\n> If a dependent is unable to independently own or lawfully protect their own rights relating to the ownership, storage, and use of their personal and private information, a legal structure could be devised to support their needs with the support of others.\n\n> One approach could be to establish a legal guardianship or conservatorship system. This would involve a legal process where a designated guardian or conservator is appointed by a court to make decisions on the dependent's behalf regarding their personal and private information. The guardian or conservator would be responsible for managing the dependent's data and ensuring that their rights and interests are protected.\n\n> Another approach could be to establish a legal trust, where the dependent's data would be held in trust by a designated trustee. The trustee would be responsible for managing and protecting the dependent's data, in accordance with the terms of the trust and any court orders. This legal trust can be tailored to the specific needs of the dependant and the level of autonomy they wish to retain.\n\n> The legal structure that is chosen would need to be in compliance with the local jurisdiction laws, while also taking into account of the needs and autonomy of the dependent person. Additionally, it would need to be reviewed and updated on regular basis.\n\n> In both cases, the legal structure would need to provide for oversight and accountability to ensure that the dependent's rights and interests are protected, and to address any issues or concerns that may arise. This could be through regular reporting, regular reviews, or mechanisms for dispute resolution, as appropriate.\n\n> It is also important to consider involving a range of stakeholders in the design and implementation of such legal structures, such as the dependant, their guardians, family members and other support people. This will help ensure that the legal structure meets the specific needs of the dependent, respects their autonomy and rights, and is tailored to the dependant's individual needs and circumstances.\n\n> Another approach to support the needs of dependants with the support of others could be by creating a power of attorney (POA). A power of attorney is a legal document that gives someone else the authority to make decisions on behalf of the person who has granted the POA. This could be a general POA which gives someone the authority to make all types of decisions, or a specific POA which gives someone the authority to make specific types of decisions related to personal and private information. In this case, the person granting the POA (the principal) would have the right to choose who their attorney-in-fact (the person they have chosen to act on their behalf) will be, and what kind of power they will have. The attorney-in-fact should act in the best interest of the principal, and in this case of the dependent, the attorney-in-fact would manage the dependent's personal and private information according to the terms of the POA and the best interest of the dependent.\n\n> Another potential legal solution that might support dependants and their rights over their personal and private information, could be the creation of a legal representative. This could be a person, or an organization that is legally designated to represent the dependent in the management and protection of their personal and private information. This legal representative would be responsible for making decisions related to the dependent's information, such as sharing it with others or managing the privacy settings, and would act in the best interest of the dependent, while also complying with legal requirements.\n\n> It is also important to mention that, any solution that is chosen, it should not limit or restrict the dependent's rights more than is necessary to protect their best interests and they should be included in the decision making process and have the right to revoke the legal structure if they choose to do so.\n\n> In summary, there are a number of legal structures that can be devised to support the needs of dependants with the support of others, such as legal guardianship or conservatorship, legal trust, power of attorney, and legal representative. The specific legal structure chosen will depend on the jurisdiction and the specific needs and circumstances of the dependent. It is important to note that, regardless of the legal structure chosen, it should prioritize the dependent's autonomy and rights while also ensuring they are protected and their best interest is taken into account.\n\nMy Question: _How could a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier; be devised using contract law between private individuals, that may in-turn expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met?_\n\nChatGPT:\n\n> It is possible to devise a solution using contract law between private individuals that attends to the considerations provided earlier and that may expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met. One example of such a contract could be a personal data management contract.\n\n> This type of contract would outline the terms and conditions of how the dependent's personal and private information will be managed and protected. The contract would be between the dependent (or the person legally responsible for them) and the person or organization designated to manage their data, such as a guardian, attorney-in-fact, or legal representative. The contract would include information such as the scope of the data that is being managed, the rights and responsibilities of each party, and the conditions under which the contract may be terminated or modified.\n\n> The contract could include an expiration clause, which would specify a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. For example, the contract could expire when the dependent reaches a certain age or when their condition improves to a point where they are able to manage their data independently.\n\n> In addition, the contract should include provisions for regular reviews of the terms and conditions of the contract to ensure that it is still meeting the needs of the dependent and that their rights are being protected. It should also include provisions for dispute resolution, in case of any disagreement about the contract's terms or the management of the data.\n\n> It is important to note that any contract involving personal data should comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws, and that the dependent should be involved in the contract creation, review and termination process.\n\n> In summary, a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier could be devised using contract law between private individuals. This contract, such as a personal data management contract, would outline the terms and conditions of how the dependent's personal and private information will be managed and protected and includes an expiration clause that specifies a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. It should also include provisions for regular reviews and dispute resolution and comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws.\n\n> Another important aspect of this type of contract would be its enforceability. It's important to make sure that the contract is legally binding and that the rights and obligations of the parties are clearly defined and enforceable in court if needed. This can be done by including specific language in the contract that makes it clear that it is intended to be legally binding and that the parties have read and understood the terms of the contract before signing.\n\n> Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider involving legal professionals in the drafting and review of the contract, to ensure that it meets the legal requirements and that it's terms are fair and reasonable to all parties involved.\n\n> It's also worth noting that, in some cases the contract could be used in parallel with or as part of a legal framework that is established by the government such as a guardianship or conservatorship structure, or a legal trust. In this case, the contract would need to be aligned with and comply with the legal framework that is in place.\n\n> In summary, a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier could be devised using contract law between private individuals, that may in-turn expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met. This type of contract, would provide clear and enforceable terms and conditions for the management and protection of the dependent's personal and private information, and would include an expiration clause that specifies a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. It should be legally binding and comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws. It's recommended to involve legal professionals in the drafting and review of the contract, to ensure that it meets the legal requirements and it's terms are fair and reasonable for all parties involved.\n\nMy Question: _make a list of the types of circumstances relating to a human being for whom these sorts of requirements are needed to support._\n\n> 1. Children or young people who are not yet legally able to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 2. Individuals with cognitive or developmental disabilities that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 3. Elderly individuals who are experiencing cognitive decline or have diminished capacity to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 4. Individuals with mental illness that affects their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 5. Individuals who are in emergency medical situations and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 6. Individuals who are incapacitated as a result of a physical or neurological injury or illness\n\n> 7. Individuals who have a temporary or permanent loss of consciousness or brain function\n\n> 8. Individuals who are in a state of extreme distress and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n\n> 9. Individuals who are under the care of a court-appointed guardian or conservator\n\n> 10. Individuals who are in a long-term care facility or receiving in-home care.\n\n> 11. Individuals who have suffered a traumatic event or have been victims of abuse, which may affect their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.\n\n> 12. Individuals with addiction or substance abuse problems that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.\n\n> 13. Individuals who are in prison or detention centers, and may be limited in their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.\n\n> 14. Individuals with a history of homelessness, or who are currently experiencing homelessness, and may have limited access to information management and technology.\n\n> 15. Individuals who are living in remote or rural areas, and may have limited access to services and support that would help them manage their personal and private information.\n\n> It's important to note that, this list is not exhaustive and there may be other types of circumstances where support to manage personal and private information is needed, it's important to evaluate each situation and the needs of the person on a case by case basis.\n\n> It's important to keep in mind that individuals may experience temporary or permanent changes in their abilities and require different levels of support to manage their personal and private information. The key is to work with the individual and assess their specific needs to provide the appropriate level of support and to make sure that their human rights and autonomy are respected.\n\nMy Question: _please define an ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL SKOS, SOIC and SHACL that illustrates an example of how this might work._\n\n> An ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, SHACL and SOIC to illustrate an example of how this might work would be a complex task, as it would involve several steps, such as identifying the classes, properties, and relationships in the domain, defining the concepts and their hierarchies, and specifying the constraints and rules that govern the data.\n\n> However, I can provide an overview of how such an ontology might be structured, and some examples of the types of classes, properties, and relationships that would be used to represent the domain.\n\n> -  RDF (Resource Description Framework) would be used to define the basic structure of the ontology, providing a way to represent resources and the relationships between them.\n\n> -  RDFS (RDF Schema) would be used to define classes and properties, and to provide a way to specify the hierarchical relationships between classes and properties.\n\n> -  OWL (Web Ontology Language) would be used to provide more advanced modeling features, such as expressing cardinality and property restrictions, and defining classes and properties as equivalent or disjoint.\n\n> -  SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) would be used to express concepts and their relationships, and to provide a way to organize and browse the concepts in the ontology.\n\n> -  SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) would be used to specify constraints and rules that govern the data, such as data types, cardinality, and allowed values.\n\n> -  SOIC (Supporting Open Identity & Control) would be used to express information related to the human identity, their rights, and access management.\n\n> As an example, the ontology might include classes such as \"Dependent\", \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\", where \"Dependent\" would be a subclass of \"Person\" and \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\" would be subclasses of \"Agent\". The classes would be related through properties such as \"hasGuardian\" and \"hasDataManager\" where the properties would be defined as object properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\" respectively. The ontology would also include classes such as \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" which would be related through properties such as \"hasPersonalInformation\" and \"hasPrivacyRights\" where the properties would be defined as object properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" respectively. The ontology might also include properties such as \"accessLevel\" and \"permission\" which would be defined as data properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" respectively, to indicate the level of access and permission granted to the different parties involved.\n\n> The ontology would also include a class \"Data Management Contract\" which would be related to \"Dependent\", \"Guardian\", \"Data Manager\" and \"Personal Information\" through properties such as \"hasContract\", \"hasDependent\", \"hasGuardian\", \"hasDataManager\" and \"hasPersonalInformation\" to indicate the parties involved and the terms and conditions of the contract.\n\n> In addition, the ontology could also include classes such as \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\" that would be related through properties such as \"compliesWith\" linking \"Data Management Contract\" with \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\" respectively to indicate the laws that the contract must comply with.\n\n> It's important to note that this is a high level example and the details of the ontology would have to be fleshed out further, with a more detailed understanding of the domain and specific requirements. Also, the use of different vocabularies and ontologies, it is important to ensure that the ontology is consistent and coherent and that the different vocabularies and ontologies are used in a way that is consistent with their intended purpose. In addition, it is important to use established vocabularies and ontologies when they are available, to make sure that the ontology is compatible with other ontologies and can be integrated with other systems.\n\n> Furthermore, one important aspect of the ontology is to make it flexible, to allow for future changes and extensions. It should be easy to update, to add new classes, properties and relationships, and to change the existing definitions as new information is acquired.\n\n> In summary, an ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, SHACL and SOIC to illustrate an example of how the support for dependants over their personal and private information might work, would involve several steps and could make use of different vocabularies and ontologies to create a coherent and consistent model that represents the domain, while also being flexible enough to allow for future updates and extensions. The ontology would need to include classes and properties that represent the different parties involved, the personal and private information, the contract and the laws. It should also include relationships that express the connections between these different components, and constraints that ensure data accuracy and consistency, while also complying with the legal requirements.\n\nMy Question: _write a prompt for DALL·E 2 that will provide a diagram that describes this sort of systems component._\n\n> \"Please create a diagram that illustrates the different components and relationships of a system that supports the management and protection of personal and private information for dependents, including classes such as \"Dependent\", \"Guardian\", \"Data Manager\", \"Personal Information\", \"Privacy Rights\", \"Data Management Contract\", \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\". The diagram should show the relationships between these classes, such as the \"hasGuardian\" and \"hasDataManager\" properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\" respectively, and the \"compliesWith\" property linking \"Data Management Contract\" with \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\" .

It is typically non-routine and requires a high level of education, training, or experience. Examples of knowledge work include research, consulting, analysis, design, and development. This type of work is often associated with information-intensive industries such as finance, technology, and education. It is typically done by professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, and scientists, and requires the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and make informed decisions.\n\nThe creation of software for the support of socio-economic ecosystems that act to preserve human rights, support the needs of workers, and protect against exploitation and other harms can be considered a form of knowledge work. This type of software development involves the use of specialized knowledge and expertise to design, develop, and maintain software systems that support these important social and economic goals.\n\nSoftware developers engaged in this type of work may be involved in the creation of systems that help to monitor and protect the rights of workers, such as by tracking working hours and ensuring fair pay. They may also work on software that helps to prevent exploitation and other forms of abuse, such as by providing tools for reporting and tracking incidents.\n\nIn addition to technical skills, knowledge work in this context may also require a deep understanding of social and economic issues, as well as a commitment to promoting and upholding human rights. The development of software to support socio-economic ecosystems requires a high level of creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking in order to create effective and sustainable solutions to complex challenges.\n\nPhilosophy, web science, and economics can all play important roles in the production of software designed to support knowledge workers.\n\nPhilosophy can help to inform the ethical and moral principles that guide the design and development of software for knowledge work. For example, the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability may be central to the development of software that supports knowledge workers, and these principles may be grounded in philosophical theories of justice or moral reasoning.\n\nWeb science, which is the study of the structure, evolution, and use of the World Wide Web, can also be important for the production of software for knowledge work. Web science can provide insights into how people use and interact with software, as well as how to design software that is user-friendly and effective.\n\nEconomics, meanwhile, can help to inform the business and financial aspects of software development for knowledge work. This may include considerations such as the cost of development, pricing models, and the potential return on investment. Economics can also help to analyze the potential economic impacts of software for knowledge work, such as its effects on productivity and efficiency.\n\nIn relation to the activity of performing knowledge work; the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can be significantly longer than the time it takes to actually create the artifact. This is because knowledge work often involves complex, non-routine tasks that require a high level of education, training, or experience.\n\nFor example, the process of designing a concept for a web application may involve a significant amount of time spent researching and analyzing user needs, studying existing solutions, and conceptualizing and prototyping different design approaches. This process of understanding and planning can take weeks, months, or even years, depending on the complexity of the project.\n\nOn the other hand, the process of implementing the web application solution as software may involve a shorter amount of time, as it involves following a detailed plan or set of instructions to build the actual software. This implementation phase may still require a high level of skill and expertise, but it typically relies on a foundation of understanding and planning that has already been established.\n\nOverall, the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can vary greatly depending on the complexity and scope of the project. However, in general, this process of comprehension and understanding can take significantly longer than the actual process of creating the artifact.\n\nHistorically, \n\nThere are several economic methodologies that were able to be used to compensate individuals who have produced valuable works through knowledge work, even if they were not paid for their work while it was being produced. \n\nSome of those potential options included:\n\n1.  Royalties: A royalty is a payment made to the creator of a work based on the number of copies sold or the amount of revenue generated by the work. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the value that their work generates over time.\n    \n2.  Licensing: A licensing agreement allows the creator of a work to grant permission to others to use the work in exchange for a fee. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the use of their work, even if they are not directly involved in the distribution or sale of the work.\n    \n3.  Equity: In some cases, creators may be able to negotiate for an ownership stake in the company or venture that is using their work. This can provide them with a share of the profits or value generated by the work.\n    \n4.  Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding platforms allow creators to seek financial support from a large number of people, typically through small contributions. This model can be used to raise funds for the production of a work, and can also help to build a community of supporters around the work.\n    \n\n### Relationship between Fair Terms and Taxation\nIf knowledge workers are unpaid or solely funded via universal basic income (UBI), it is likely to have an impact on taxation income. UBI is a form of social security that provides a guaranteed income to all citizens, regardless of their employment status or income level.\n\nIf knowledge workers are receiving UBI as their primary source of income, it is likely that they will not be paying taxes on their income, as UBI is typically designed to be tax-free. This could reduce the overall amount of taxation income collected by the government.\n\nOn the other hand, if knowledge workers are not being paid for their work at all, it is possible that they may be reliant on other forms of government assistance, such as welfare payments or unemployment benefits. In this case, the government may still be incurring costs to support these individuals, even if they are not generating taxation income through their work.\n\nOverall, the impact of unpaid or UBI-funded knowledge workers on taxation income will depend on the specific details of the UBI program and the broader economic context.\n\n### Relationship between Economics and Intellectual Property\nIf knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are not compensated or acknowledged for their contributions towards works that are later commercially exploited by others without lawful licensing rights, it can have a number of negative impacts on intellectual property rights.\n\nFirst and foremost, it can undermine the principle of fair compensation for intellectual property, which is a key aspect of intellectual property law. If knowledge workers are not being fairly compensated for their contributions, it can discourage them from continuing to create and innovate, which can have a negative impact on the overall development and growth of the field.\n\nIn addition, the unauthorized exploitation of intellectual property can also lead to disputes and legal conflicts. If knowledge workers are not properly compensated or credited for their work, they may seek legal remedies to protect their rights and seek fair compensation. This can result in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings, which can be disruptive to businesses and industries that rely on the exploitation of intellectual property.\n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are fairly compensated and acknowledged for their contributions. This can help to promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem, which is essential for fostering innovation and economic growth.\n\nIn general, it is not lawful to obtain intellectual property from a knowledge worker if they are not compensated for their work. Intellectual property law provides legal protections for the creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. These protections typically include the right to be compensated for the use of the intellectual property.\n\nIf a knowledge worker creates a work that is protected by intellectual property law, they have the right to be compensated for its use. This may include payment for the use of the work, or an agreement to share in the profits generated by the work. Without such an agreement, it is typically not lawful to use the work without the knowledge worker's consent.\n\nThere are some limited exceptions to this rule, such as the \"fair use\" doctrine in copyright law, which allows for limited use of copyrighted works without permission in certain circumstances, such as for the purpose of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, these exceptions are typically narrow and do not allow for the unrestricted use of intellectual property without compensation.\n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers are fairly compensated for their valuable intellectual property in order to respect their rights and promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem.\n\nThrough the development of the [[WorkProject]] new solutions become available.

These rights are intended to encourage innovation and creativity by allowing creators to control the use of their creations and to benefit from their exploitation.\n\nThere are several different types of intellectual property, including:\n\n1.  Copyright: Copyright protects original works of authorship, such as literature, music, and artwork.\n    \n2.

The Response was as follows,\n\nCarbon credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to offset carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon credits are used as a way to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and to promote the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\nUnder a carbon credit system, a government or other authority sets a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted within a specific region or sector. Companies or other organizations that exceed their allocated carbon emissions are required to purchase carbon credits from those that have emitted less than their allocated amount. This creates a market for carbon credits, with the goal of reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions and incentivizing the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\nCarbon credits can be bought and sold on carbon markets, such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) or the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX).

Fungible goods or assets are interchangeable, meaning that they can be used to satisfy a debt or obligation regardless of their specific characteristics or qualities.\n\n*For example, money is a fungible asset because it can be exchanged for any other good or service of equal value. Gold is also a fungible asset because it can be traded for other gold or for other goods or services of equal value. In contrast, non-fungible goods or assets are unique and cannot be exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value. For example, a work of art or a collectible item is non-fungible because it has a unique value that cannot be replicated or replaced.*\n\n*Another term for fungibility is exchangeability. When a good or asset is exchangeable, it means that it can be traded or exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value. Exchangeability is closely related to the concept of fungibility, and the two terms are often used interchangeably to refer to the property of goods or assets that can be traded or exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value.*\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/CriminalActivity/CorporateCrime/","title":"Corporate Crime"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Corporate Crime\n\n*Chat AI:*\n\nCorporate crime refers to illegal or unethical activities that are committed by a business or corporation.

Therein also - often they're subjected to blackmail and other threats of consequences if they ever do anything that would act to deconstruct the proxy attack method (as to expose the underlying actors). \n\nPart of the consequence of these attacks becomes; that WHEN the attacker and any people who supported acts of wrong-doing find out that they've engaged in wrongful behaviour, they're compromised and thereafter aligned with the values framework of the underlying attacker - which thereafter, becomes part of the broader [[DigitalSlavery]] and [[Dehumanisation]] issues that are related to [[CorporateCrime]] in particular, although not exclusively.

I relate the practice of slavery to two different concepts of “alienation from self”: first, as being “owned” as property by a third party; and, second, as being “owned” in a more informal, contemporary sense, through the removal of an individual’s ability to govern her own life. This dual meaning of alienation from self leads me to consider self-ownership in a legal sense as well as, less formally, as having the agency to determine one’s own life. From both perspectives I claim that the increasing trafficking of personal data to supply algorithm-based analytics and AI is enabling a new form of digital enslavement that has the potential to curtail liberty and cause harm. I suggest that the conceptualization of problematic digital practices as a new form of slavery is a much needed addition to the mainstream critique of the collection, aggregation and trafficking of personal data, which has focused mostly on individual privacy. \n\nThis focus, in turn, has obscured and diminished the seriousness of concerns about collective and individual autonomy.\n\n[**#SlaveTech A snapshot of slavery in a digital age**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ueLcAiuue26NIZRyhSD8UGdx2vEBKSht/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThousands of years ago Aristotle wrote that ‘the ox is the poor man’s slave’. But how can an ox be a slave? And how is a slave like an ox? The crucial link is that in this context, both the ox and the human are being used as tools. In fact, Aristotle said exactly that in his book Politics: “some tools are lifeless and others living”, explaining that “for a helmsman the rud- der is a lifeless tool and the enslaved watchman a live tool.” It is not too difficult to think of animals and people as ‘tools’, and while it is less likely we would say an animal or a man is ‘technology’, they are and can be that too. In modern English slang, calling someone a “tool” is a put- down, an insult. And most of us would shy away from so di- minishing a person’s humanity, so reducing their personhood, by thinking or saying that another human being is only a tool. Recognition of our common humanity leads us to hate the idea of treating people as things. But that may be why we fail to see how closely linked technology (tools) and slavery can be, and so fail to see how the ox and the slave are similar, and how their differences make the slave the much more profitable and useful of the two.\n\n[**Modern Indentured Servitude in the Gig Economy: A Case Study on the Deregulation of the Taxi Industry in the United States**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WCuTv-P0yyDRIPi0qC8WRdInLrb4vtQo/view?usp=sharing)\n\nUnsustainable business model: The broken promises of Gig economy companies While corporations like Uber pursue intensified vehicular autonomy, that which has lured so many workers to the Gig economy in the United States has been hope in the American dream through the promise of ongoing employment .

Drivers were told they could work for a ride-hailing company like Uber, and they could choose to work whenever they wanted. But what drivers were not told upon signing up, or on leasing or buying a new vehicle to drive for Uber, is that their per mile and per minute rate would be slashed without warning, not once but consecu- tively.

The 4P paradigm serves as the foundational framework used universally to combat human trafficking.\n\n[**Combating modern slavery experienced by Vietnamese nationals en route to, and within, the UK**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sow7NsyVQXX7AA-o6gSXpg4xy_tWZYn9/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIn 2016 the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner (IASC) commissioned research to examine the dynamics of Vietnamese nationals’ exploitation en route to, and within, the United Kingdom (UK). The research took a mixed method approach and included analysis of National Crime Agency (NCA) National Referral Mechanism (NRM) data, NRM files for 75 Vietnamese victims who had received a positive conclusive grounds (PCG) decision, 61 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in Vietnam and the UK and 11 life history interviews with Vietnamese potential victims of modern slavery who at the time of fieldwork had received a positive reasonable grounds (PRG) decision.

It is essential to sense-making and cooperation and so then to the fundamental processes of human life. It is complex in its operations and so in its descriptions; it means different things to different people in different contexts. In light of the deep digitalization of our world, developments in computer science affect everyone. Many applications of computer science concern people and relationships, our interactions with each other and with digital technology, and with our cyborgian extension, and so I can only consider the diligent digital mediation and augmentation of human identity to be the discipline’s foremost challenge. Historic systemizations of identity have brought advantages and disadvantages, great benefits and grave harms, and I have this in mind when observing computer scientists currently developing protocols and technologies to systematize a narrow conceptualization of identity at scales and with a potential intensity never before contemplated let alone pursued. We need to have a deeper think about this.\n\n[**Paving a Digital Road to Hell? A Primer on the Role of the World Bank and Global Networks in Promoting Digital ID**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qC8TAcA1Dkzf1UtFIk50qoEuk1dreP4I/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe Digital Welfare State and Human Rights Project originally emerged from our support of the mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. The initial focus was on the digital transformation of welfare states in the Global North, including in the United States and United Kingdom.1 However, during the preparation of the 2019 Special Rapporteur’s report to the UN General Assembly on digital welfare states,2 many practitioners and academic experts drew our attention to a specific model of digital identification systems, frequently with biometric components (digital ID systems), which is being deployed by national governments in the Global South. Recognizing that these systems raise major human rights concerns that go far beyond the realm of Northern welfare states, we have spent the past few years increasingly engaged in national and international debates on digital ID.\n\n[**Human and Machine Consciousness**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4509pvw8Iwo_yk6QtIxqzY1UopoycT3/view?usp=sharing)\n\nConsciousness is extremely important to us. Without consciousness, there is just nothingness, death, night. It is a crime to kill a person who is potentially conscious. Permanently unconscious people are left to die. Religious people face death with hope because they believe that their conscious souls will break free from their physical bodies. We know next to nothing about consciousness and its relationship to the physical world. The science of consciousness is mired in philosophical problems. We can only guess about the consciousness of coma patients, infants and animals. We have no idea about the consciousness of artificial systems.\n\n[**The Age of Digital Interdependence**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oI0S8hJpm_BUB64heZ3J4dmP36FvQw8D/view?usp=sharing)\n\nDigital technologies are rapidly transforming society, simultaneously allowing for unprecedented advances in the human condition and giving rise to profound new challenges. Growing opportunities created by the application of digital technologies are paralleled by stark abuses and unintended consequences. Digital dividends co-exist with digital divides. And, as technological change has accelerated, the mechanisms for cooperation and governance of this landscape have failed to keep pace. Divergent approaches and ad hoc responses threaten to fragment the interconnectedness that defines the digital age, leading to competing standards and approaches, lessening trust and discouraging cooperation.\n\n\n[**Crypto & DeFi Hacks, Fraud & Scams Report**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DspMneosLPsSdFX6QSjgfr3XPmUxo12Q/view?usp=sharing)\n\nDespite the constant evolution and maturation of blockchain technology and the crypto market, 167 attacks on Decentralized Finance protocols, 123 security attacks, and 74 fraudulent schemes over the last 11 years have so far resulted in the theft of approximately USD $14.58 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets in total at the time of writing this report (July 2022).\n\n\n[**The Promise and Perils of International Human Rights Law for AI Governance**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YvsBvPxRKZ_Nmh_17SupJ8CAkMjF4HZD/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe use and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) presents many challenges for human rights. Consequently, the search for an AI governance framework has led to a relatively recent proliferation of government strategies, corporate ethics codes, engineering design ethics, and international regulatory frameworks that seek to regulate its application. For purposes of this paper, AI—a term that has no consensus definition in technology and policymaking circles1—refers to a complex information system that approximates behavior commonly understood as requiring intelligence, similar to human behavior, such as pattern recognition, logical reasoning, or language processing.\n\n[**The Commodification of Knowledge and Information**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lztgk-MSbS22vAPyzSk5mNF4InLTjfnW/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIn this paper we present an analysis of the commodification of knowledge and information in contemporary capitalism. We provide a consistent account of how information as a commodity effects the workings of both capitalism and of Marxist theory. The first part of the paper critically revisits Marx’s own writings on the commodification of knowledge and how the immaterial labour hypothesis initially interpreted these writings. Based on the new categories knowledge-commodity and knowledge-rent, we then present our own approach in response to the challenges raised by the immaterial labour hypothesis. Lastly, we analyse the more recent contributions on the commodification of knowledge and information within the Marxist literature. The current debate on the value of knowledge has been divided between two camps: the reproduction cost approach, and the average cost approach. At the end of the paper we present empirical estimates of the magnitudes of knowledge-rents.\n\n[**Beyond Data Alessandro Mantelero Foreword by Prof. Joe Cannataci Human Rights, Ethical and Social Impact Assessment in AI**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SLZpk3Je-QG7M0i7XbivmPg4EKqIXoAZ/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIt is probably safe to say that at the time of writing1 more than 99% of the world’s population do not yet understand what a game-changer AI can be...or is already proving to be. Much news coverage, for example, is still given to efforts which aim to prevent states like Iran or North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and increasingly sophisticated means of delivering them. Yet relatively little news coverage is given to the fact that, in reality, AI has made nuclear weapons obsolete. Why would a state—or indeed a terrorist—wish to deploy or acquire a very expensive and relatively unstable nuclear weapon when it can instead deploy much cheaper AI-controlled devices which do not create a radioactive crater or destroy so many valuable assets in a target zone?\n\n[White Paper eDATA Verifiable Credentials for Cross Border Trade](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wGmuNE22cAk3HFJqggvOldz8g484BqIr/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe international supply chain is growing in complexity at the same time as nation states seek to improve their border compliance for imports and facilitate access to export markets for their domestic producers. The global value chain is highly dependent on smooth cross-border supply flows (tangible, intangible, and data). In an uncertain world that is buffeted by rapid technological change, environmental and health crises, and political uncertainties, national policies can have significant impacts on cross border trade challenges.\n\nThe “cost of trade”2 roughly doubles the landed price of goods in export markets (compared to domestic wholesale prices) with around one third of that cost related to non-tariff border costs. Nations that can reduce their cost of trade with their trading partners will confer a significant comparative advantage for their exporters and thereby improve the national balance of trade.\n\n·  At around $1.7 Trillion USD, the trade finance gap (i.e. trade finance requested but not approved) is heavily weighted against small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and acts as one of the most significant barriers to SME participation in cross-border trade. Nations who can uplift SME participation rate in cross border trade will experience greater growth and improved balance of trade.\n\n·  At around 3% of world trade volume, the value of fake / illicit goods trade is at least $600Bn and rising. The consequences include market losses for exporters of genuine goods and potential reputational damage for entire market segments. Nations who can help their exporters prove the authenticity of goods will enjoy a comparative advantage over those that do not.\n\n·  With annual carbon emissions at around 25 billion tons5 and with approximately 25 million people in forced labour, and 400 million tons of hazardous waste produced annually, there is a rapidly increasing consumer demand for sustainable products. Nations that can prove the sustainability of their exported goods through verifiable supply chain transparency will enjoy both higher prices for their goods and lower tariffs as importing nations start to penalize un-sustainable imports.\n\n·  With border authorities only able to inspect around 1% of around 1 billion sea containers8 and a much smaller proportion of 100 billion parcel shipments9 per year, the challenge of managing border risk against illicit goods and biosecurity threats has never been greater. Nations that can leverage high integrity data about import consignments can both increase seizures and facilitate legitimate imports. \n\nThe challenges described above are quite significant. Equally, the opportunities for nations that can address these challenges more effectively than their competitors are also significant. Digitisation is a key enabler of all strategies to address these challenges. Although many nations have made significant progress in digitizing trade processes within their borders such as implementing trade single windows, there remain significant challenges in digitizing cross-border processes.\n\nDiverse regulatory models and priorities across nations amplify the challenge. National policy making will reflect a complex mixture of market-oriented, security-oriented, rights-oriented, and domestic development-oriented priorities. These differences lead to problems of compatibility or interoperability among nations, and fragmentation of the digital space at the global level. Any scalable solution to the digitisation of cross border trade must embrace and not conflict with diverse policy making priorities.\n\nThis paper describes a highly scalable operating model for digitisation and trust of cross border trade based on verifiable credentials, linked data, and decentralised identifiers. It provides national regulators with implementation guidance that will facilitate the following outcomes.\n\n[**Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humans** ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sMxmWpWvx3IA7uvsUbXCDEi39K4NUOq5/view?usp=sharing)\n\nExperts say the rise of artificial intelligence will make most people better off over the next decade, but many have concerns about how advances in AI will affect what it means to be human, to be productive and to exercise free will\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/CyberAttackVectors/MisRepresentation/","title":"MisRepresentation"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"This note about MisRepresentation attack vectors notes circumstances where a person may use a 3rd party identifiers/ accounts and perform activities on that account in a manner that is intended to mislead other persons to believe it was the account holder undertaking those activitites, rather than the attacker.\n\nThere are various examples of where this may be employed as part of a broader attack.\n\nSome examples are more closely related to [[CriminalActivity]] and wrong-doings seeking to cause injury, however others may simply be circumstances such as instances where children make use of their parents accounts to make purchases or perform other activities online that they're unable to do themselves alone. \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/CyberAttackVectors/NobodyAI/","title":"NobodyAI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The concept of Nobody AI refers to AI and/or software solutions that are designed in such a way whereby the use of those systems may cause harm to others; but that it is the fault of no human being - by design.

It refers to the trade-off between short-term gains and long-term costs when making decisions about how to design, develop, and maintain technology systems.\n\nTech debt is incurred when a team chooses to take shortcuts or make compromises in order to deliver something quickly, but at the cost of making it more difficult or expensive to maintain or modify in the future. For example, using a quick-and-dirty solution to a problem instead of taking the time to design a more elegant, maintainable solution would be considered taking on tech debt.\n\nTech debt can also be incurred when a team is under pressure to deliver something quickly and doesn't have the time to implement best practices or follow industry standards. This can lead to code that is hard to understand or maintain, making it more difficult to add new features or fix bugs in the future.\n\nThe interest on tech debt is the cost of maintaining the software or system. This can include the cost of fixing bugs, adding new features, or making changes to the system. The longer the debt is unpaid, the more the interest compounds and the more expensive it becomes to maintain the system.\n\nIn summary, \"Tech debt\" refers to the cost of maintaining and updating technology systems, it occurs when a team chooses to take shortcuts or make compromise in order to deliver something quickly, but at the cost of making it more difficult or expensive to maintain or modify in the future. It's important to balance the short-term gains and long-term costs when making decisions about how to design, develop, and maintain technology systems.\n\n***My Question: What are the Cyber Security Risks and Threats that are brought about as a consequence of Tech Debt?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nTech debt can introduce a variety of cyber security risks and threats, some of which include:\n\n1.  Vulnerabilities: Tech debt can lead to vulnerabilities in the system, such as poor code quality or a lack of testing. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or take control of the system.\n    \n2.  Unpatched software: Tech debt can make it more difficult to keep software up to date with the latest security patches. This can leave systems open to known vulnerabilities that have already been fixed in more recent versions of the software.\n    \n3.  Outdated software: Tech debt can also make it more difficult to upgrade to newer versions of software, which may have better security features. This can leave systems open to newer threats that have emerged since the software was last updated.\n    \n4.  Lack of monitoring: Tech debt can make it more difficult to monitor systems for suspicious activity. This can make it harder to detect and respond to cyber attacks in a timely manner.\n    \n5.  Lack of compliance: Tech debt can make it difficult to comply with regulations and industry standards for data security. This can lead to fines and reputational damage for the organization.\n    \n6.  Difficulty in incident response: Tech debt can make it difficult to quickly detect a security incident and respond to it, which can prolong the incident and increase the damage caused by it.\n    \n7.  Difficulty in performing security testing: Tech debt can also make it difficult to perform security testing on systems and applications, as the complexity and lack of maintainability of the codebase can make it hard to identify vulnerabilities or simulate realistic attack scenarios.\n    \n8.  Difficulty in understanding the attack surface: Tech debt can make it difficult to understand the attack surface of the system, which can make it harder to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.\n    \n9.  Difficulty in implementing new security controls: Tech debt can make it difficult to implement new security controls, such as encryption or multi-factor authentication, as the complexity and lack of maintainability of the codebase can make it hard to integrate new features.\n    \n10.  Difficulty in incident response: Tech debt can also make it difficult to perform incident response, as the complexity and lack of maintainability of the codebase can make it hard to identify the cause of an incident, understand the scope of the incident, and implement countermeasures.\n    \n11.  Difficulty in forensic analysis: Tech debt can make it difficult to perform forensic analysis on systems and applications, as the complexity and lack of maintainability of the codebase can make it hard to understand the state of the system at the time of an incident.\n    \n\nTech debt can lead to a variety of cyber security risks and threats, such as vulnerabilities, unpatched software, outdated software, lack of monitoring, lack of compliance, and difficulty in incident response. It's important for organizations to manage and mitigate tech debt to minimize these risks and protect their systems and data from cyber attacks.\n\nIn summary, Tech debt can introduce a variety of cyber security risks and threats such as vulnerability, unpatched software, outdated software, lack of monitoring, lack of compliance, difficulty in incident response, difficulty in performing security testing, difficulty in understanding the attack surface, difficulty in implementing new security controls, difficulty in forensic analysis and so on. It's important for organizations to manage and mitigate tech debt to minimize these risks and protect their systems and data from cyber attacks.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/StrategicHarms/AcademicInstitutionalFunnelling/","title":"Academic / Institutional Funnelling"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Academic / Institutional Funnelling\n\nThese sorts of attack vectors are described in relation to [[CommercialExploitation]] mechanisms; where the objective of the attacker is to engender benefit indirectly.\n\nThis may include [[Manipulation]], [[Dehumanisation]], [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]], works to [[Compromise]] and engender [[Impairment]] whilst delegating [[AuthorisedThinkers]] who may in-turn be young, yet enthusiastic yet overwelmingly otherwise - somewhat innocent (and often also - not treated well themselves!). \n\nBy funneling works via [[FalseAttribution]] related tactics into large institutions, the institutions provide a barrier and/or defence framework, that protects any underlying person who is wilfully engaged in [[StrategicHarms]] and perhaps also [[CriminalActivity]].\n\nThe use of Academic or institutions to funnel activities that are built upon wrongs; through the use of students as a form of proxy that is intended to support an agenda for gainful purpose; whilst leading to the miseuse of students or other nieve persons as pawns; which, when related to [[CriminalActivity]] and an underlying intent to mitigate possibility of consequences and/or prosecution, etc.  is a particularly complex problem."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/CyberAttackVectors/permanentIdentifiers/","title":"Permanent Identifiers"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Permanent Identifiers\n\nSome protocols do not support the ability to remove a record once it has been submitted to that protocol.

Dehumanization can have serious consequences, as it can lead to discrimination, violence, and other forms of abuse. It can also have psychological and emotional impacts on those who are dehumanized, as it can cause them to feel degraded, marginalized, and disconnected from society.

A News Article from [wired](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/fake-news-document-eli-pariser) talks about the situation and [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPghC4ra6QLhaHhW8QvPJRMKGEXT7KaZtG_7s5-UQrw/edit) (noting, its important to review the historical versions of the document as its often defaced)\n\nA version of my contributions are provided below (i'm unsure if or how its been altered); noting, that the content was authored to highlight solutions rather than the problem.\n\n## Considerations → Principles → The Institution of Socio - Economic Values\n\nby: [Timothy Holborn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous) \n\nA Perspective by Eben Moglen [from re:publica 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKOk4Y4inVY)\n\nThe problem of ‘fake news’ may be solved in many ways.  One way involves mass censorship of articles that do not come from major sources, but may not result in news that is any more ‘true’.  Another way may be to shift the way we use the web, but that may not help us be more connected. Machine-readable documents are changing our world.  \n  \nIt is important that we distill ‘human values’ in assembly with ‘means for commerce’. As we leave the former world of broadcast services where the considerations of propaganda were far better understood; to more modern services that serve not millions, but billions of humans across the planet, the principles we forged as communities seem to need to be re-established.  We have the precedents of Humans Rights, but do not know how to apply them in a world where the ‘choice of law’ for the websites we use to communicate, may deem us to be alien.  Traditionally these problems were solved via the application of Liberal Arts, however through the advent of the web, the more modern context becomes that of Web Science incorporating the role of ‘philosophical engineering’ (and therein the considerations of liberal arts via computer scientists).\n\nSo what are our principle, what are our shared values? And how do we build a ‘web we want’ that makes our world a better place both now, and into the future? \n\nIt seems many throughout the world have suffered mental health issues as a result of the recent election result in the USA.  A moment in time where seemingly billions of people have simultaneously highlighted a perceived issue where the results of a populous exacting their democratic rights resulted in global issues that pertained to the outcome being a significant surprise.   So perhaps the baseline question becomes; how will our web better provide the means in which to provide us (humans) a more accurate understanding of world-events and circumstances felt by humans, via our ‘world wide web’.\n\n**# Linked-Data, Ontologies and Verifiable Claims  \n\nBy:  [@Ubiquitous](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous) \n  \nLinked-Data is a technology that produces machine and human readable information that is embedded in webpages.  Linked-Data powers many of the online experiences we use today, with a vast array of the web made available in these machine-readable formats.  The scope of linked-data use, even within the public sphere, is rather enormous.\n\nRight now, most websites are using ‘linked data’ to ensure their news is being presented correctly on Facebook and via search, which is primarily supported via [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) .\n\nThe first problem is: that these ontologies do not support concepts such as genre.  This means in-turn that rather than ‘news’ becoming classified, as it would in any ordinary library or newspaper, the way in which ‘news’ is presented in a machine-readable format is particularly narrow and without (machine readable) context. \n\nThis means, in-turn, that the ability for content publishers to self-identify whether their article is an ‘advertorial’, ‘factual’, ‘satire’, ‘entertainment’ or other form of creative work - is not currently available in a machine-readable context. \n\nThis is kind of similar to the lack of ‘emotions’ provided by ‘social network silos’ to understand ‘sentiment analysis’ through semantic tooling that offer means to profile environments and offer tooling for organisations.  Whilst Facebook offers the means to moderate particular words for its pages product this functionality is not currently available to humans (account holders).  \n\nThe mixture of a lack of available markup language for classifying posts, alongside the technical capabilities available to ‘persona ficta’ in a manner that is not similarly available to Humans, contributes towards the lack of ‘human centric’ functionality these platforms currently exhibit. \n\n### Bad Actors and Fact-Checking\n\nIn dealing with the second problem (In association to the use of Linked-Data), the means in which to verify claims is available through the application of ‘credentials’ or Verifiable Claims which in-turn relates to the Open Badges Spec.  \n\nThese solutions allow an actor to gain verification from 3rd parties to provide their audience greater confidence that the claims represented by their articles.  Whether it is the means to “fact check” words, ensure images have not been ‘photoshopped’ or other ‘verification tasks’, one or more reputable sources could use verifiable claims to in-turn support end-user (reader / human) to gain confidence in what has been published.  Pragmatically, this can either be done locally or via the web through 3rd parties through the use of Linked-Data.  For more information, get involved in W3C, you’ll find almost every significant organisation involved with Web Technology debating how to build standard to define the web we want.\n\n  \n### General (re: Linked Data)\n\nIf you would like to review the machine-readable markup embedded in the web you enjoy today, one of the means to do so is via the Openlink Data Sniffer  An innovative concept for representing information was produced by Ted Nelson via his Xanadu Concept\n\nAdvancements in Computing Technology may make it difficult to trust media-sources in an environment that seemingly has difficulty understanding the human-centric foundations to our world; and, where the issues highlighted by many, including Eben Moglen, continue to grow.  Regardless of the technical means we have to analyse content, it will always be important that we consider virtues such as kindness; and, it is important that those who represent us, put these sorts of issues on the agenda in which “fake news” has become yet another example (or symptom) of a much broader problem (imho).  \n  \n\nA simple (additional) example of how a ‘graph database’ works as illustrated by this DbPedia example.  The production of “web 3.0” is remarkably different to former versions due to the volume of pre-existing web-users.  Whilst studies have shown that humans are not really that different, the challenge becomes how to fund the development costs of works that are not commercially focused (ie: in the interests of ‘persona ficta’) in the short-term, and to challenge issues such as ‘fake news’ or indeed also even, how to find a ‘Toilets’.  As ‘human centric’ needs continue to be unsupported via the web or indeed also, the emerging intelligent assistants working upon the same datasets; the problem technologists have broadly produced becomes that of a world produced for things that ‘sell’, without support for things we value. Whether it be support for how to help vulnerable people, receipts that don’t fade (ie: not thermal, but rather machine-readable), civic services, the means to use data to uphold ‘rule of law’, vote and participate in civics or the array of other examples in which we have the technology, but not the accessible application in which to apply the use of our technology to social/human needs.  \n\nIndeed the works we produce and contribute on the web are for the most-part provided not simply freely, but at our own cost.   The things that are ‘human’ are less important and indeed, poorly supported.**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/StrategicHarms/FalseAttribution/","title":"False Attribution"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# False Attribution\n\nActivities relating to False Attribution; includes but is not limited to, Plagiarism,  [[CommercialExploitation]], [[Dishonesty]], [[FakeNews]] and various other techniques that have various implicit and explicit implications.  \n\nAn agent engaged in activities that relate to False Attribution are unable to show the provonance of the work in question extending prior to the works that it is based upon.\n\nThese issues are often linked to the problems described by [[TheSecret]] \n\nNOTE:  This needs to be expanded upon more - WIP TODO LIST..."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/StrategicHarms/Impairment/","title":"Impairment"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"An Impairment attack vector is a form of organised behaviour where the objective is to engender circumstances where the target is no longer able to pursue works that others may not want to happen, may consider to give rise to jeopardy of being 'found out' (ie: [[CriminalActivity]] / [[FinancialCrimes]]) or may also relate to personal circumstances.\n\nThe objective process will seek to ensure that the target is made incapable.\n\nImpairment attacks may include obstructive behaviour and/or strategic works that seek to instigate circumstances where the person becomes flooded with problems, Revoking their ability to earn income / obtaining / removing their customer base / income sources.\n\nThese sorts of methods are supported by various [[TemporalAttacks]] vector issues, whereby the ability to remedy the consequences of these attacks, is often not viable as a consequence of the amount of time it takes to address the repercussive implications of the attack; whilst those involved in prosecuting the attack, benefit and progress.

It is often used in the context of public officials or employees who are expected to adhere to high standards of integrity and ethical conduct in their roles.\n\nProbity is an important concept in public life, as it is essential for maintaining trust in public institutions and systems. Public officials and employees who demonstrate probity are seen as trustworthy and reliable, and they are more likely to be respected and trusted by the public.\n\nProbity can be demonstrated through a number of behaviors, such as honesty, transparency, fairness, and accountability. It is important for individuals and organizations to uphold high standards of probity in order to maintain public trust and confidence. This can involve implementing strong internal controls and compliance programs, training employees on ethical business practices, and holding individuals accountable for their actions.\n\nThe opposite of probity is impropriety, which refers to the act of behaving in an improper or unethical manner, particularly while in a position of trust or authority. Impropriety can take many forms, such as corruption, abuse of power, or engaging in activities that are not in the public interest.\n\nImpropriety can have serious consequences for both the individuals and organizations involved, as it can undermine trust in public institutions and systems and result in significant financial losses.

It is often used to obstruct justice or to interfere with legal proceedings.\n\nWitness tampering can take many forms, such as threatening or intimidating a witness, offering a witness a bribe or other inducement to not testify or to testify falsely, or withholding or destroying evidence. It is illegal and can result in criminal charges and severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.\n\nOverall, it is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the risks of witness tampering and to take steps to prevent and detect it. This can include implementing strong internal controls and compliance programs, training employees on ethical business practices, and holding individuals accountable for their actions.\n\nIn addition to witness tampering, there are other terms that might be used to describe the sort of wrongdoing you described, such as:\n\n-   Obstruction of justice: This refers to the act of interfering with the administration of justice or the investigation or prosecution of a crime.

Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation in that there is no [privity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privity \"Privity\") of contract; these torts are likely to involve [pure economic loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_economic_loss \"Pure economic loss\") which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the \"foreseeability\" doctrine.[35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-47) The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently applied[36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-48) and began in 1965 from a California case involving strict liability for product defects; in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the doctrine in _East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Deleval, Inc_.[37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-:0-49) In 2010, the [supreme court of the U.S. state of Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Supreme_Court \"Washington Supreme Court\") replaced the economic loss doctrine with an \"independent duty doctrine\".[38](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-50)\n\nEconomic antitrust torts have been somewhat submerged by modern [competition law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law \"Competition law\"). However, in the United States, private parties are permitted in certain circumstances to sue for anticompetitive practices, including under federal or state statutes or on the basis of common law [tortious interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference \"Tortious interference\"), which may be based upon the [Restatement (Second) of Torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restatement_of_Torts,_Second \"Restatement of Torts, Second\") §766.[39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-51)\n\nNegligent misrepresentation as tort where no contractual [privity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privity \"Privity\") exists was disallowed in England by _[Derry v Peek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_v_Peek \"Derry v Peek\")_ [1889]; however, this position was overturned in _[Hedley Byrne v Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedley_Byrne_v_Heller \"Hedley Byrne v Heller\")_ in 1964 so that such actions were allowed if a \"special relationship\" existed between the plaintiff and defendant.[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52) United States courts and scholars \"paid lip-service\" to _Derry_; however, scholars such as [William Prosser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Prosser_(academic) \"William Prosser (academic)\") argued that it was misinterpreted by English courts.[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52) The case of _[Ultramares Corporation v. Touche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramares_Corporation_v._Touche \"Ultramares Corporation v. Touche\")_ (1932) limited the liability of an [auditor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditor \"Auditor\") to known identified beneficiaries of the audit and this rule was widely applied in the United States until the 1960s.[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52) The [Restatement (Second) of Torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restatement_of_Torts,_Second \"Restatement of Torts, Second\") expanded liability to \"foreseeable\" users rather than specifically identified \"foreseen\" users of the information, dramatically expanding liability and affecting professionals such as accountants, architects, attorneys, and [surveyors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying \"Surveying\").[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52) As of 1989, most U.S. jurisdictions follow either the _Ultramares_ approach or the Restatement approach.[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52)\n\nThe [tort of deceit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_of_deceit \"Tort of deceit\") for inducement into a contract is a tort in English law, but in practice has been replaced by actions under [Misrepresentation Act 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrepresentation_Act_1967 \"Misrepresentation Act 1967\").[41](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-53) In the United States, similar torts existed but have become superseded to some degree by contract law and the pure economic loss rule.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54) Historically (and to some degree today), fraudulent (but not negligent[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54)) misrepresentation involving damages for economic loss may be awarded under the \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" rule (damages identical to [expectation damages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_damages \"Expectation damages\") in contracts[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54)) which awards the plaintiff the difference between the value represented and the actual value.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54) Beginning with _Stiles v. White_ (1846) in Massachusetts, this rule spread across the country as a majority rule with the \"out-of-pocket damages\" rule as a minority rule.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54) Although the damages under the \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" are described as compensatory, the plaintiff is left better off than before the transaction.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54) Since the economic loss rule would eliminate these benefits if applied strictly, there is an exception to allow the misrepresentation tort if not related to a contract.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/Torts/Nuisance/","title":"Nuisance"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Source: Wikipedia\n\n\"Nuisance\" is traditionally used to describe an activity which is harmful or annoying to others such as indecent conduct or a rubbish heap. Nuisances either affect private individuals (private nuisance) or the general public (public nuisance). The claimant can sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. In English law, whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was \"for the benefit of the commonwealth\", with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Nuisance-43) The case _Jones v Powell_ (1629) provides an early example, in which a person's professional papers were damaged by the vapors of a neighboring brewery. Although the outcome of this case is unclear,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Nuisance-43) Whitelocke of the [Court of the King's Bench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England) \"Court of King's Bench (England)\") is recorded as saying that since the water supply in area was already contaminated, the nuisance was not actionable as it is \"better that they should be spoiled than that the commonwealth stand in need of good liquor\".[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn English law, a related category of tort liability was created in the case of _[Rylands v Fletcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylands_v_Fletcher \"Rylands v Fletcher\")_ (1868): strict liability was established for a dangerous escape of some hazard, including water, fire, or animals as long as the cause was not remote. In _[Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Water_Co_Ltd_v_Eastern_Counties_Leather_plc \"Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc\")_ (1994), chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's water reservoirs.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-ElworthyHolder-44) The _Rylands_ rule remains in use in England and Wales.

In order to win an action for negligence, a plaintiff must prove: duty, breach of duty, causation, scope of liability, and damages. Further, a defendant may assert various defences to a plaintiff’s case, including comparative fault and assumption of risk. Negligence is a tort which arises from the breach of the [duty of care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care \"Duty of care\") owed by one person to another from the perspective of a [reasonable person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person \"Reasonable person\"). Although credited as appearing in the United States in _[Brown v. Kendall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Kendall \"Brown v. Kendall\")_, the later Scottish case of _[Donoghue v Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donoghue_v_Stevenson \"Donoghue v Stevenson\")_ [1932] AC 562, followed in England, brought England into line with the United States and established the 'tort of negligence' as opposed to negligence as a component in specific actions.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-31) In _Donoghue_, Mrs. Donoghue drank from an opaque bottle containing a decomposed snail and claimed that it had made her ill. She could not sue Mr. Stevenson for damages for breach of contract and instead sued for negligence. The majority determined that the definition of negligence can be divided into four component parts that the plaintiff must prove to establish negligence.\n\nIn most common law jurisdictions, there are four elements to a negligence action:[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-32)\n\n1.  duty: the [defendant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant \"Defendant\") has a duty to others, including the [plaintiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff \"Plaintiff\"), to [exercise reasonable care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care \"Duty of care\")[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-34)\n2.  breach: the defendant breaches that duty through an act or culpable omission\n3.  damages: as a result of that act or omission, the plaintiff suffers an injury\n4.  causation: the injury to the plaintiff is a reasonably foreseeable[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-36) consequence of the defendant's act or omission under the [proximate cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_cause \"Proximate cause\") doctrine.[[j]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-39)\n\nSome jurisdictions narrow the definition down to three elements: duty, breach and proximately caused harm.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-owen-40) Some jurisdictions recognize five elements, duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, and damages.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-owen-40) However, at their heart, the various definitions of what constitutes negligent conduct are very similar. Depending on jurisdiction, [product liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_liability \"Product liability\") cases such as those involving warranties may be considered negligence actions or fall under a separate category of [strict liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_liability \"Strict liability\") torts. Similarly, cases involving environmental or consumer health torts which other countries treat as negligence or strict liability torts are treated in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_law_in_India \"Tort law in India\") as [absolute liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_liability \"Absolute liability\") torts.\n\nIn establishing whether a duty of care exists, different common law jurisdictions have developed a variety of distinct but related approaches, with many jurisdictions building on the test established in _[Anns v Merton LBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anns_v_Merton_LBC \"Anns v Merton LBC\")_. In Singapore, the current leading case is _[Spandeck Engineering v Defence Science and Technology Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandeck_Engineering_v_Defence_Science_and_Technology_Agency \"Spandeck Engineering v Defence Science and Technology Agency\")_, which builds on _Anns_ by establishing a two step test comprising an analysis of [proximate cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_cause \"Proximate cause\") and [public policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy_doctrine \"Public policy doctrine\") as a universal test, independent from the individual circumstances of a given case, for determining the existence of a duty of care. The Supreme Court of Canada established a similar test in the context of assessing damages for [pure economic loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_economic_loss \"Pure economic loss\") owing to negligence derived from _Anns_ which consists of a two step examination of the existence of a sufficiently proximate relationship between the parties and public policy considerations; however, the Canadian test is more sensitive to the individual circumstances of a given case and the first step is generally deemed to be met where a case falls into one of three [sets of circumstances recognised by precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_tort_law#Negligence \"Canadian tort law\") while the Singaporean test is independent of precedent. In English tort law, _[Caparo Industries plc v Dickman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caparo_Industries_plc_v_Dickman \"Caparo Industries plc v Dickman\")_ established a tripartite test for the existence of a duty of care per which harm must be reasonably foreseeable as a potential result of the defendant's conduct; the parties must be in a relationship of proximity; and it must be fair, just, and reasonable to impose such a duty."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebCivicsCharter/SocialAttackVectors/Torts/IntentionalTorts/","title":"Intentional Torts"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Intentional Torts\n\nSource: Wikipedia.\n\nIntentional torts are any intentional acts that are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so. Intentional torts have several subcategories:\n\n-   [Torts against the person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass#Trespass_to_the_person \"Trespass\") include [assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_(tort) \"Assault (tort)\"), [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(tort) \"Battery (tort)\"), [false imprisonment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment \"False imprisonment\"), [intentional infliction of emotional distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress \"Intentional infliction of emotional distress\"), and fraud, although the latter is also an [economic tort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_tort \"Economic tort\").\n-   Property torts involve any intentional interference with the property rights of the claimant (plaintiff). Those commonly recognised include trespass to land, trespass to chattels (personal property), and conversion.\n-   Dignitary torts are a category of intentional tort affecting the honour, dignity, and reputation of an individual and include: [Defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation \"Defamation\")[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-41), [invasion of privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_privacy \"Invasion of privacy\"), [breach of confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_confidence \"Breach of confidence\"), torts related to the justice system such as [malicious prosecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_prosecution \"Malicious prosecution\") and [abuse of process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_process \"Abuse of process\"), and torts pertaining to sexual relations that are considered obsolete in most common law jurisdictions such as [alienation of affection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affection \"Alienation of affection\") and [criminal conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conversation \"Criminal conversation\").\n\nAn intentional tort requires an overt act, some form of intent, and causation. In most cases, transferred intent, which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual, will satisfy the intent requirement.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-42) Causation can be satisfied as long as the defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm."},{"fields":{"slug":"/placeholder/","title":"This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx"},"frontmatter":{"draft":true},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx\ndraft: true\ntags:\n  - gatsby-theme-primer-wiki-placeholder\n---\n"}]}}}
